This algorithm works by assigning membership to each data point corresponding to each cluster center on the basis
of distance between the cluster center and the data point. More the data is near to the cluster center more is its
membership towards the particular cluster center. Clearly, summation of membership of each data point should be
equal to one. After each iteration membership and cluster centers are updated according to the formula.
