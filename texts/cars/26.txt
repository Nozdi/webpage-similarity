It's hard to beat the value of the Smart Fortwo Cabrio, which includes a power top, air conditioning, and an automatic transmission for about the same price as a decently-equipped Honda Civic. The Fortwo's multi-stage folding top gives it more flexibility than most convertibles, though you have to remove the roof side rails for the true convertible experience -- but if you leave the rails in place, you can open and close the roof at any speed. The Smart offers more interior room than you would expect given its size, but its busy ride, tepid acceleration and susceptibility to crosswinds make it better suited to local drives than long trips. (Incidentally, Smart also makes the least-expensive electric convertible, priced at $21,250 after Federal tax incentives.)
