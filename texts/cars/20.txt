2011 Ford Fiesta test drive

Ford is getting back into the small-car business with the Fiesta -- a European-developed subcompact designed to take on competent rivals like the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Nissan Versa and Scion xD (and not-so-competent rivals like the Chevrolet Aveo). The Fiesta's European flair is an integral part of the way it looks and the way it drives. It...

2010 Ford Taurus SHO

Twenty years ago, Ford unleashed the Taurus SHO: Sensible family car on the outside, renegade on the inside. 2010 brings an all-new SHO built around Ford's new EcoBoost V6, a 3.5 liter engine with direct fuel injection and twin turbos that develops 365 hp. The 2010 Ford Taurus SHO sounds good on paper, but how does it work on the street? Read on. 2010 Ford Taurus SHO: Tested and reviewed by Aaron Gold, your Guide to Cars at About.com.

2010 Ford Taurus test drive

When Ford says their iconic Taurus is all new for 2010, they aren't kidding: It's got new exterior styling, a new cabin, a new suspension setup -- and, Ford hopes, a new type of buyer. Has Ford taken the 2010 Taurus in the right direction? Read on. 2010 Ford Taurus: Tested and reviewed by Aaron Gold, your Guide to Cars at About.com.

2010 Ford Fusion Sport test drive

Ford has given its mid-size Fusion a serious make-over for 2010, including an updated exterior, improved cabin, revised engines, and a new top-of-the-line Sport model. I've always thought the Ford Fusion was underrated and underappreciated. Will the 2010 Ford Fusion fix that?

2011 Ford Fiesta preview drive

Ford's subcompact 2011 Fiesta won't hit American streets until early 2010, but Ford gave me a chance to check out the European version of the Ford Fiesta. I got a good feel for the 2011 Ford Fiesta's styling and practicality -- and a good feeling that, if Ford doesn't change it too much, the 2011 Ford Fiesta is going to be a very successful car. 2011 Ford Fiesta: Tested and reviewed by Aaron Gold, your Guide to Cars at About.com.

2009 Ford Focus SES Coupe test drive

Ford redesigned the Focus in 2008; for 2009 they've jazzed up the top-of-the-line SES coupe with subtle styling tweaks, a roof-mounted spoiler, and 17" wheels. Manual-transmission cars get a 3-hp bump while automatics get a lower final drive ratio to boost acceleration. Safety also gets a boost, with a new electronic stability control system and rear headrests. How does it all come together?
