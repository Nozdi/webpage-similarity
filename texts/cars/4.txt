Looking for inexpensive wheels? Here are the least expensive cars on sale in America. We've driven all of them, and we'll tell you which cheap cars are the real deals -- and which ones are the real duds.

You might expect America's least expensive car to be some undersized econobox, but the Nissan Versa is actually a surprisingly capable family car, offering as much space as most mid-size sedans for a little more than half the price of a base-model Toyota Camry. The styling is homely and creature comforts are few and far between, but the Versa does come with air conditioning and a CD stereo as standard equipment, and the options are reasonably priced -- a top-of-the-line Versa with power windows and locks, an automatic transmission, alloy wheels, Bluetooth and navigation -- navigation, for goodness sake! -- still costs less than the cheapest Honda Civic.
