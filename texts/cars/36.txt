On Friday, July 7, 2006, Chevrolet's Camaro concept made an appearance at the Bob's Big Boy friday-night cruise-in in Burbank, California -- with Jay Leno at the wheel. About.com Cars' BJ Killeen was there to check the car out and grab a few snaps. If it goes into production, the Camaro will be a challenger to Chrysler's Dodge Challenger , which will go into production in 2008.
