The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX (Evo 9 to its friends) is like Frank Sinatra: So talented that it can get away with behaving badly. This is one of the meanest, fastest, most capable cars you can buy, with the power and agility to embarrass exoticars twice (or thrice) its price. It's not for novices; if you light a fire under the Evo's cauldron, you'd better know what to do when it boils. But skilled hands can play it like a Baldwin Grand. $31,399 and worth every penny.

Don't let appearances fool you: The Evo 9 isn't just some tarted-up subcompact. Virtually every piece you see on the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX -- the hood scoops, the minimalist wheels, the hug-you-like-your-mother seats -- everything (with the possible exception of the trunk spoiler) contributes to make the Lancer Evolution IX a frighteningly fast car. Behind the holes in the hood resides the intercooler that helps give the Lancer it's blinding speed, while the big red brake calipers peeking out from behind lightweight wheels make the Evo's deceleration just as impressive. And underneath it all is an all-wheel-drive system and a suspension as firm as Frank's handshake that gives the Evo it's seemingly impossible grip on the road. The aesthetics are, I think, quite nice; the flared fenders, aggressive front end and restyled taillights separate it from the frumpy work-a-day Lancer. It's almost hard to believe these two are related, but they are, at least in terms of the body -- though in character, the two cars are about as similar as Dean Martin and Ice Cube.

If I blindfolded you and sat you down in the Evo's cabin, you'd never guess this was a performance car. (Actually, you might never guess it was a car at all until I took off the blindfold.) Aside from the Recaro racing seats and some trim bits, the Evo's tourist-class interior is virtually identical to lesser Lancers. What you see and feel will be influenced by which Evo you choose. There are three members of the Evo rat pack: The standard $31,399 Evolution IX, with most of the bits youÂ’d expect in a nicely-equipped compact, like power windows, locks and mirrors, CD player, antilock brakes (ABS), air conditioning and keyless entry; the $35,189 Evolution MR, which adds a 6-speed manual transmission, unique wheels and trim bits, a lightweight aluminum roof, and unique shock tuning (more on that in a moment) ; and the $28,679 Evolution RS, the purist's Evo. Designed to race, it features the aluminum roof and eliminates weight-adding nice-to-haves: No power windows, no power locks, no map lights, no ABS, no stereo, and -- praise be! -- no spoiler. For some inexplicable reason it retains the air conditioning system. Evos offer few options, and an automatic transmission isn't among them.

Here's where the Evo shows its true talent. Thanks largely to a turbocharger, intercooler, and a diet of premium fuel, the Evo pulls an amazing 286 horsepower from a relatively small 2-liter 4-cylinder engine. But it's the poster child for turbo lag; below 2500 RPM it has all the gusto of a self-propelled lawnmower. The show starts at 3500 RPM when the turbo springs to life and all hell breaks loose. Three words of advice: Hang on tight. Do it right and the Evo can be launched from 0 to 60 MPH in less than 5 seconds. But doing it right is harder than it seems; it involves high revs and precise clutch action. If you don't get it just right, you either bog the engine (embarrassing) or smoke the clutch (expensive). There's no safe way to explore the Evo's handling limits outside of a racetrack. It clings to the pavement like old gum and virtually explodes out of the corners. The racing suspension and Yokohama performance tires are the stars of the show, but they carry a penalty: The ride is punishing and on bumpy roads the Evo jumps around like a butterfly on amphetamines. The Evo MR has slightly softer shock tuning that takes the edge off just enough to make the ride tolerable, with a virtually negligible difference in handling.

At the risk of sounding like a crotchety old fart, let me stress that the Evo is not for inexperienced drivers. If you buy an Evo, be sure to invest in a performance driving program, or at least get some track or autocross experience. If the Evo gets away from you, it'll happen fast; knowing what will happen and how to regain control is critical to avoiding bent metal and broken bones. More pitfalls: The Lancer Evolution has a healthy appetite for clutches and tires, and Mitsubishi is famous for voiding the warranty if they even suspect you've been racing (odd, considering that's what the Evo is designed to do). The Evo has only one real competitor: The Subaru WRX STi. The STi is a bit more civil, but I've known it to do some nasty things at its handling limits with little warning. The Evo may be rude, but at least it's predictable. And the Evo's choice of models (versus the STi's one) allows buyers to choose the best ride/handling balance for their needs. Me, I'd take the Evo over the STi, no question. The Lancer Evolution IX is one of the most talented track cars that can legally roam the streets. Just remember to treat it like you would Frank: Show it the proper respect or else it might just kick your ass.
