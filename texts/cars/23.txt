You've probably read the news by now that Toyota is planning to move their headquarters from Torrance, California (near Los Angeles) to Texas. Nissan USA, which was headquartered fairly close to the Toyota campus, moved to Tennessee a few years back, and us Californians are wondering if nearby Honda won't follow suit.

Christie Schweinsberg, a colleague who writes for Ward's Auto, wrote a strongly-worded editorial opining that a move to Texas is hypocritical considering Toyota's assertion of a commitment to the environment and Texas' less-than-stellar eco credentials. (I know Christie personally, by the way, and I find her to be a very thoughtful and intelligent journalist.)

Of course, many people are saying that California's taxes and strict environmental regulations are driving Toyota to Texas -- but this article in the Los Angeles Times says "it ain't necessarily so". According to the article, Toyota is citing the simple expedient of moving closer to their American assembly plants.

What do you think? Does moving out of California reflect negatively on Toyota's eco-credibility? Should Toyota consider quality of life vs. cost of living for its employees? Click the "comments" link and share your thoughts. -- Aaron Gold
