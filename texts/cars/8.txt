It's a busy week for me -- I run an off-road event for the Motor Press Guild, an organization for auto journos and PR people in southern Cali, and it's coming up next week. If you're curious to see the kind of stuff we do, check out this video.

Meanwhile, Frank Aukofer sent me his thoughts surrounding the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang -- and Frank was there at the beginning. With all due apologies to Jonathan Lamas, here's Frank:

Amid all the hoopla over the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang, I would add some sober notes.

First, it was all about styling, which then as now is what sells cars. The car itself, like most of the domestic machinery in the mid-sixties, was actually mediocre. I wrote about the first one in 1964. It was cobbled up from Falcon and Fairlane parts, had a 170 cubic inch in-line six-cylinder engine with a floor-mounted three-speed manual gearbox (with no synchro on first gear) and handling that completely mimicked its parent cars, which is to say it was miserable.

Over the years, I tried different Mustangs and it was always the same. Even with automatic transmissions and V8 power, they were always still terrible, mainly in the handling department.

When Ford revived the Shelby Mustang name a few years back, they brought Carroll Shelby himself, then 84 years old, to the press preview in Dearborn, on a cold and rainy day in July. I sat with Shelby in one of the spare cars for about 45 minutes of conversation and told him that I had never liked Mustangs until Ford got serious about them with the new Shelby GT. I said my disappointments applied to the Shelby GT350 and GT500 models back in the 1960s, as well as to other muscle cars of the 1970s.
