Players 

2 players. 
Equipment 

A game board and six pieces for each player (checkers or coins work well for the playing pieces). 
Goal 

The goal is to get your opponent down to two pieces, or to block him from making any legal moves. 
Setup 

The board is made up of two concentric squares, with three points marked on each side of each square (the two corners and a midpoint). The same-side midpoints of both squares are connected by a straight line. A total of 16 points are marked on the board. 

Here is a Six Men's Morris board (PDF). 
Gameplay 

Setup Phase: Players taking turns laying their pieces on vacant points. 

Regular Phase: After all 12 pieces have been laid down, the regular phase begins. In this phase, a turn consists of sliding a piece along a line to a vacant point. 

Whenever a player creates a string of three pieces on one line, he immediately removes one of his opponent's pieces. (This can happen during the setup phase or the regular phase.) However, an opponent's piece which is part of a string may not be removed unless no other piece is available. 
NOTE: Sliding a piece one space on one turn, then back to its original space on a subsequent turn is a legal sequence. 
Winning 

The first player to get his opponent down to two pieces, or to block his opponent from making any legal moves, is the winner.
