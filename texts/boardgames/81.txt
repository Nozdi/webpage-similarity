In the Ticket to Ride Card Game, players work to collect sets of illustrated Train cards. These cards are used to complete Destination Tickets (routes between two cities depicted on each ticket). Players also face the new risk of "train-robbing," where another player can steal their Train cards. 

"I wanted to make sure that players of the Ticket to Ride Card Game would recognize the family resemblance to the board game, but also get to enjoy new and distinctive game play." game designer Alan R. Moon said in a press release. "It has the familiar simplicity of the original game -- drawing cards, playing cards, drawing tickets -- but the game play itself is fresh and new." 

The Ticket to Ride Card Game is for 2 to 4 players, ages 8 and older. It includes 96 train cards, 46 Destination Tickets, and 6 Big Cities Bonus cards. Each game takes about 30 minutes. 

The game is available in 10 languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish). The suggested retail price is $25 in the U.S. and â‚¬15 in Europe.
