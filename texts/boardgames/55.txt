5 stars -- Mmm... 5 stars. Sit me down and let me play!

4 stars -- Superior. I always look forward to playing this game and will suggest it regularly.

3 stars -- A solid game, but nothing spectacular. I'll play anytime someone suggests it and will occasionally suggest it myself.

2 stars -- There's something I like about this game, maybe even enough to play it again -- but only if someone asks.

1 star -- Someone, somewhere might enjoy this game. But not me.

0 stars -- I cannot recommend purchasing this game to anyone.

Our rating system also employs half-star ratings when appropriate.
