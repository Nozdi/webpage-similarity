This solitaire card game, which is almost entirely driven by luck, is closely related to the game Clock. Here are the complete rules for Watch Solitaire. Players 1 player. Deck A standard 52-card deck. Goal Complete all other four-of-a-kind sets before the fourth King is revealed twice. Setup Shuffle the deck. Deal the cards, face down, into 13 piles of four cards each. The piles should be arranged to mimic the numbers on a clock, with the extra pile in the middle of the circle. The "numbers" of the piles (1 through 12 on the clock; the middle pile is 13) are important. Gameplay Turn the top card on the 13 pile face up (that's the pile in the middle of the circle). Place it, still face up, under the pile of that card's number. For example, a 4 would go under the 4 pile. An Ace would go under the 1 pile. Face cards are placed as follows: Jack under 11, Queen under 12, King under 13. Then turn the top card on that pile face up and place it, still face up, under the appropriate pile. Continue in this manner until the game ends (see "Winning" below). If the final face-down card in a pile belongs to that same pile, continue the game by turning the next (moving clockwise) face-down card face up. Getting Stuck When you reveal the fourth King and move it to pile 13, you'll be stuck. The first time this happens, take the King and exchange it with any face-down card still remaining. Continue by turning the face-down card face up and placing it under the appropriate pile. Winning You win if all 13 piles become face-up piles of four-of-a-kind. However, you lose if the fourth King is turned face up a second time before all the other sets are completed. Watch Solitaire is only won about 5 percent of the time.
