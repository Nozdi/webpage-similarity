Baker's Dozen Solitaire is a distant relative to Klondike Solitaire and a very close relative of Good Measure. Players 1 player Deck A standard 52-card deck. Goal Build all four suits up from ace to king in separate piles. Setup Deal a row of 13 cards, face up. Then deal three more rows, each row overlapping the previous one. When finished, all 52 cards should be visible in 13 columns of four each. This creates the tableau. Move all four Kings to the bottom of their respective columns. See Baker's Dozen Solitaire - Illustrated Setup for an example. Foundations As they become available, the four Aces must be played above the tableau; these are the four foundations. Cards of the same suit may be played on each Ace in ascending order, from low (2) to high (King). Only cards which are completely uncovered may be played on a foundation. Once a card is played on a foundation, it can't be removed. Playing on the Tableau If it is uncovered, the next-lowest card may be moved to the top of a tableau pile, regardless of suit or color. EXAMPLE: The 9 of hearts can be played on the 10 of diamonds, clubs or spades. If a column in the tableau is emptied, it remains empty. Winning You win Baker's Dozen Solitaire by building all four suits up from Ace to King.
