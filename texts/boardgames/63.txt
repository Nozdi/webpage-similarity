Each year, the contest also has a specific theme. In 2001, the theme was using an 8x8 game board; in 2002, designers had to create a game that employed unequal forces; for 2003, we asked designers to create a game in which both players moved simultaneously; for 2004, shared pieces was the theme; and in 2005, we asked designers to create a deduction game. 

Many of the best entries, including all of the winners, have been published on this site. Some are from successful game designers -- for example, Bruce Glassco (Betrayal at House on the Hill), Don Green (Octi), Stephen Glenn (Balloon Cup), and Michail Antonow (Caribbean) have all submitted games to one or more of our competitions. 

The complete rules to these games are available on this web site, and since one of the basic design elements is that the games must be playable "using pieces most people are likely to have around the house," you can play them almost anytime at all.
