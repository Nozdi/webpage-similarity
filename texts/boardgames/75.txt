It's rare to win this solitaire card game, which is entirely driven by luck. Clock is also known as Four of a Kind, Hidden Cards, Sun Dial, and Travelers. Here are the complete rules for Clock Solitaire. Players 1 player. Deck A standard 52-card deck. Goal Complete all other four-of-a-kind sets before the fourth King is revealed. Setup Shuffle the deck. Deal the cards, face down, into 13 piles of four cards each. The piles should be arranged to mimic the numbers on a clock, with the extra pile in the middle of the circle. The "numbers" of the piles (1 through 12 on the clock; the middle pile is 13) are important. Gameplay Turn the top card on the 13 pile face up (that's the pile in the middle of the circle). Place it, still face up, under the pile of that card's number. For example, a 4 would go under the 4 pile. An Ace would go under the 1 pile. Face cards are placed as follows: Jack under 11, Queen under 12, King under 13. Then turn the top card on that pile face up and place it, still face up, under the appropriate pile. Continue in this manner until the game ends (see "Winning" below). If the final face-down card in a pile belongs to that same pile, continue the game by turning the next (moving clockwise) face-down card face up. Winning You win if all 13 piles become face-up piles of four-of-a-kind. However, you lose if the fourth King is turned face up before all the other sets are completed. Clock Solitaire is only won about 1 percent of the time.
