Block Ten Solitaire is a very quick game, generally played in about two minutes. It's almost entirely dependent on luck, and players should win about 10 percent of the time. Block Ten is closely related to the solitaire card game Tens. Players 1 player Deck A standard 52-card deck. Goal Deal the entire deck onto the table without reaching an impasse. Setup Shuffle the deck. Deal nine cards, face up, in three rows of three cards each (creating a 3x3 grid of face-up cards). Set the remaining cards to the side, face down, to form the draw pile. Gameplay You may discard any two cards in the 3x3 grid which add up to 10 (i.e., Ace and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6, 5 and 5). You may also discard any two matching face cards (i.e.: Jack and Jack, Queen and Queen, King and King). When you discard, replace the missing cards with the top cards from the draw pile. If you get all 52 cards into the 3x3 grid, you win.
