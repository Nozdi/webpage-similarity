Tens Solitaire is a very quick game, generally played in about two minutes. It's almost entirely dependent on luck, and players should win about 12.5 percent of the time. Tens is closely related to the solitaire card game Block Ten. Players 1 player Deck A standard 52-card deck. Goal Deal the entire deck onto the table without reaching an impasse. Setup Shuffle the deck. Deal 13 cards face up in two rows of five cards each and one row of three cards. All 13 cards should be visible and accessible. NOTE: Some people prefer to make the game easier by using 15 cards, dealing three rows of five cards each. Set the remaining cards to the side, face down, to form the draw pile. Gameplay You may discard any two face-up cards which add up to 10 (i.e., Ace and 9, 2 and 8, 3 and 7, 4 and 6, 5 and 5). You may also discard any set of four matching face cards (i.e.: four Jacks, four Queens, four Kings). Replace all discarded cards with the top cards from the draw pile. If you get all 52 cards onto the table, you win.
