The card game Golf Solitaire derives its name from the fact that the lower you score, the better you've done. Here are the complete rules for Golf Solitaire. Players 1 player. Deck A standard 52-card deck. NOTE: Aces are always low; Kings are always high. Goal Remove all cards from the tableau. Setup Shuffle the deck. Deal a row of seven face-up cards. Then deal four more rows of seven face-up cards, each overlapping the previous row. (You should be able to see the values of all 35 cards when the dealing is complete.) This is known as the tableau. The remaining 17 cards form the draw pile. See Golf Solitaire - Illustrated Setup for an example. Gameplay Deal one card from the draw pile and place it face-up on the table, starting the discard pile. Cards may be removed from the top of the tableau (i.e. with no other cards on top of them) and added to the discard pile if they are in sequence. "In sequence" means either one rank above or one rank below (suits are irrelevant). EXAMPLE: The first card in the discard pile is a 6. You may move an uncovered 7 or an uncovered 5 from the tableau to the top of the discard pile. Discards may go up and then down again. EXAMPLE: The top card on the discard pile is a Q. It's legal to play a sequence of cards like this on top of the Q: J-10-9-8-9-10-J-Q-K. NOTE: When a K is showing on the discard pile, you may not start back down with a Q. One of Golf Solitaire's main strategies revolves around making sure you can discard the Ks. At the end of the first turn, deal the second card from the draw pile to the top of the discard pile and add cards from the tableau as described above. Repeat this for all 17 cards in the draw pile. After the draw pile is exhausted, the game ends. Scoring Your score is equal to the number of cards remaining in the tableau. The lower your score, the better. Winning Play several games to see how low you can score.
