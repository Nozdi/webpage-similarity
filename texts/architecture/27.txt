Tower 4 is a skyscraper of dual heights and differing geometries. Floors 15 to 54 have parallelogram-shaped interior office spaces, but the high-rise section of the tower (floors 57 to 72) has trapezoidal floor plans (see floor plans). Maki and Associates designed the tower with indented opposite corners, which allows interior floors to have not four, but six corner officesâ€”column-free, of course. Location: 150 Greenwich Street, New York CityExpected Completion: 2013Height 977 feet; 72 storiesArchitect: Fumihiko Maki and AssociatesConstruction Materials: Steel, reinforced concrete, glass facade "The fundamental approach to the design of the project is two-fold - a 'minimalist' tower that achieves an appropriate presence, quiet but with dignity, on a site facing the Memorial and a 'podium' that becomes a catalyst in activating/enlivening the immediate urban environment as part of the redevelopment efforts of lower Manhattan."
