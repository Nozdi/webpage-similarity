Thomas Oliver Larkin is often credited with combining East Coast architectural designs with the Spanish building materials found in the West and Southwest to create a new architectural style. Larkin's design is a basic two-story New England colonial house, blended with the wide wooden balconies found in the Tidewater, and all built upon the local Spanish-influenced adobe dwelling. This combination became known as Monterey Colonial Style, or simply Monterey Style. Larkin's new East meets West blend is often said to be the first two-story house style in California. The design was copied, replicated, and modernized in the 20th century, and Monterey Revival homes can be found throughout the U.S. LARKIN HOUSE
The adobe-and-wood Larkin House was built in 1835 by Thomas Oliver Larkin, a Yankee merchant who came to California in April 1832. Since Larkin was the only U.S. consul to California under Mexican rule, his home became the American consulate from 1844 to 1846, and it was also used as military headquarters by Kearny, Mason, and Sherman.
