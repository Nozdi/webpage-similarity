  of Contents   Travis C. McDonald, Jr. Evidence, questions, and hypotheses must be continually evaluated during investigation. 
  Like a detective constructing a case, an investigator must sort out information 
  to get at "the facts." Yet, are the "facts" conclusive at 
  any time?  Observations made during the surface mapping may identify random features. 
  These features begin to form patterns; then, sets of patterns, perhaps representing 
  alterations from multiple eras, begin to appear. If the right questions are 
  not asked, the evidence can remain hidden. Hypotheses are formed, questioned, 
  tested, re-formed and either rejected or substantiated. This process is repeated 
  as more "facts" are uncovered and questions asked. Eventually the 
  evidence seems conclusive. These conclusions, in turn, may lead to re-examination, 
  more historical research, and the advice of specialized consultants. At some 
  point, treatment generally follows based on the collective, educated conclusions 
  of an entire professional team.  Next
