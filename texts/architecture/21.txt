Historian Sally McMurry, author of Families & Farmhouses in 19th Century America (compare prices), found that many home plans published in 19th century farm journals were designed by women. These women-designed houses were not the fussy, highly ornamented structures fashionable in the cities. Designing for efficiency and flexibility rather than fashion, farm wives ignored rules set down by urban architects.
 
2. Birthing Rooms
Women-designed houses tended to include a first floor bedroom. Sometimes called the "birthing room," the downstairs bedroom was a convenience for women in childbirth and the elderly or infirm. 
3. Living Space for Workers
Many women-designed houses included private quarters for workers and their families. The workers' living space was separate from the main household. 
4. Porches
A home designed by a woman was likely to include a cool porch that served double-duty. In the hot months, the porch became a summer kitchen. 
5. Ventilation
Women designers believed in the importance of good ventilation. Fresh air was considered healthy, and ventilation was also important for the manufacture of butter.
