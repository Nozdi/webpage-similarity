The house was 
  built in 1914 a few hundred feet from a former rail depot. Certainly many homes 
  from this era were built from kits sold by Sears and Roebuck, Aladdin Homes, 
  Montgomery Wards and other mail order companies. However, Phil has not been 
  able to locate the original catalog listing or plans for this house.  Using a home 
  design graphics program, he drew up a set of floor 
  plans. Does the style of the house seem familiar? As you look at the floor 
  plans, do you recognize the layout of the rooms?  Use
