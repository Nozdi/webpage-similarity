The family tree is filled with multiple marriages.  Look carefully at the marriage dates and the birth dates of their children.  Many children were born illegitimately or born only a couple months after marriage.  Although the graph shows Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois Schicklgruber's father, this is a contested issue. 
 
Did you notice that Hitler had a living sister? We often think of him as a loner, but his sister Paula survived him. 

 
Also, Alois Schicklgruber's first wife has not been included.  He married Anna Glassl-HÃ¶rer (1823-1883) in October 1873.  Anna became an invalid soon after the marriage, in 1880 she filed for a separation, and she died three years later.  Alois and Anna had no children together.
