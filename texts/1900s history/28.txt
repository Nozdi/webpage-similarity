Flapper Dresses in Style (1925): Flappers were young women in the 1920s whose dress, hair style, and attitude were much different than the Gibson Girl, the image of the ideal woman just a generation earlier.
Flappers dressed somewhat like a boy; they tightly wound their chest with strips of cloth in order to flatten it and chopped off most of their hair. The waists of flapper clothes were dropped to the hipline. The hem of the skirts also started to rise in the 1920s. At first the hem only rose a few inches, but from 1925 to 1927 a flapper's skirt fell just below the knee.
