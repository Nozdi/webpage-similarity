The great Sci-Fi flicks of the 1950s were responsible for creating an atmosphere of awe and wonderment in me at what lies beyond our Earth in the vastness of space. I was raised in a religious family, yet a belief in a higher power never created a contradiction for me in the possibility of intelligent life somewhere other than planet Earth. This passion and belief stayed with me thoughout my life as I amassed a large collection UFO related material. After working in the UFO area of several online web sites, I finally fulfilled a dream and began my own, the  UFO Casebook website.  I have written over 400 articles on UFO and alien sightings.
