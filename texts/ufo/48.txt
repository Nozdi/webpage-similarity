Commercial Airline Pilot Saw Phoenix Lights A commercial airplane pilot has come forward in March of this year, claiming to have seen the original Phoenix Lights in 1997. Because of his occupation, and position in the community, he must remain anonymous, and has kept his secret since 1997. On the night of the original lights, he and his wife were driving home in the West Valley. The pilot said, "All of a sudden, with some urgency, my wife said, 'what are those lights?'" The pilot had spent years flying helicopters in Vietnam, and also fighter jets at Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, and thought he could readily identify the puzzling lights in the sky. He could not. Attempting to Identify "Then I noticed, 'Wow, no anti-collision lights, no navigation lights,' said Greg. I kind of just stood there, watching the lights go overhead. And then I realized, 'Wow, I don't really know what these are!'" The pilot's inability to identify the unknown objects in the sky did not make him the exception, but the rule on this particular night. Various explanations were offered to solve the mystery of the Phoenix Lights, but to no avail. Although the military admitted to dropping flares southwest of Phoenix, the main object sighted was described as a black, triangle-shaped craft with seven lights. Various Views In reference to the military explanation of lights, our eyewitness made this statement: "I've actually dropped flares from the air in Vietnam, what I saw wasn't flares." Conspiracy theorists and extraterrestrial proponents jumped on the event, insisting this is proof that we earthlings are not alone. Fife Symington, governor at the time, would admit 10 years later that he saw them, too, calling the lights "otherworldly." "I do wish that I could see them again, our witness said, when I fly at night now, I kind of keep an eye out, because I'd really like to see that V of lights again someday." And maybe he will.
