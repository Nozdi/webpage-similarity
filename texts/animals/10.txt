Dog bite prevention is a necessity in today's world. Dogs are everywhere, and some are friendlier than others. As dog owners, we must take responsibility for training our dogs and keeping them under our control at all times. We must also help spread awareness to others about proper behavior around dogs, dog safety, and preventing dog bites.

It is important to understand that ANY dog is capable of biting, regardless of breed or size. Even the nicest dog can snap or bite when injured or afraid. All children and adults should learn how to keep themselves safe around dogs. Most importantly, dog owners must be responsible for their dogs.

Dog bites can be prevented if the proper measures are taken. Remember responsible dog ownership and education of the public are the keys to safety.
