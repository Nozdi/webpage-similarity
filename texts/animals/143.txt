I went to the shelter only twice- once when I met my pet, Dorian, and once to bring him home with me. Although the shelter was large and had many animals, I was prepared to look and wait patiently until the right cat found me. I had studied and talked with cat owners and been told that this is often the way their cats came to be theirs. When I visited that first day there were, as usual, cages full of kittens, entire litters. I slowly and carefully looked at them, pet some of them, cooed at them, admiring their adorable tiny features and array of colors, their playfulness and squirming tails. Then I walked by one large cat who was nearly a year old. His cage could hardly contain him at his robust 14 lbs. Someone had named him Peanut Butter, but his beautiful, long hair was bright white, with black and gray markings. "PB" had a gray and black ringed tail just like a little raccoon! I stopped to say hello to the big guy. "Hi there," I said, "Look at you in that little cage," I sighed. I just didn't like him to be in there. But his infectious energy and enthusiasm shined through in the brightest green eyes as he looked up at me. I thought I would raise a kitten, but then it occurred to me to wonder why? I thought this over and began to move past PB, when one elegant, white paw struck out at me twice! He attempted to stop me, to tap me with his paws! As I gently opened the cage to take Peanut Butter out and hold him, I read his info sheet: He had no front claws and was already neutered. I had to admit, that was helpful for a first-timer like me who would have her hands full just setting up a good cat home! PB let me pet him as he stood stoically on the little table provided by the shelter. He was shy but not afraid. I could tell already that he wanted to like me, wanted to know that I was "okay" and to be free to play with me. What a sweetheart! I am so grateful that PB knew what he was doing that day and knew he had to get my attention before I walked along!
