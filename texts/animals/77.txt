Although named after the raccoon, contrary to popular folklore, the Maine Coon cat is not the result of a cat breeding with a raccoon; more likely is the story of a cross between an American domestic cat and a long-haired cat (possibly an Angora), brought by ship from Europe.

Equally at home with children, dogs, or older persons, the Maine Coon is an ideal pet, handily earning its status as the second most popular breed in America, as well as its fond nickname, "The Gentle Giant." Who can resist this beautiful cat?
