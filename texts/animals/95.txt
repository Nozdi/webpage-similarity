It may be puzzling to learn that some of the ways cats show their love might cause us to think just the opposite. For instance a cat may shred your favorite chair with his claws to show his love (possession) of you, according to Amy Shojai, former Contributing Writer .

There's no doubt at all, though that these nursing kittens are all purring and kneading to show how happy they are, and how much they love their mom cat. No doubt, some of them will grow up to demonstrate their love for their human moms and dads in much the same way, as Amy described above. Amy came up with 14 different ways cats demonstrate love for their humans. Can you think of other ways? Feel free to add your comments here.
