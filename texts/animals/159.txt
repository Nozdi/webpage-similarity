 "Alex is an 18 pound 4 year old tabby that we adopted about three years ago. Before we got him, he had an accident with a fan belt, and consequently, has no tail. He is assertive and mushy, all at the same time. As you can see, he will go to any extent to make sure that his supervisory efforts get noticed!"
