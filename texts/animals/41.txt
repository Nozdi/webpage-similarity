The Pet Emergency Pocket Guide by Informed® is a valuable reference that simplifies pet care by providing daily care guidelines, first aid, travel advice, emergency planning, and proper responses to pet injuries, illnesses, and emergencies.

The Pet Emergency Pocket Guide by Informed® is quite the handy little booklet for pet owners. This reference flip-book is tab-divided to easily access topics. The guide begins with the "find it" tab, which describes how to use the book and serves as a kind of table of contents. The tabs that follow go into detail about emergencies, general dog and cat information, first aid, a glossary of signs and conditions, then information about spay/neuter, pregnancy and birth. The final section discusses planning for travel and disasters. The back cover has a helpful index, making it even easier to find information fast. Many of the sections in Pet Emergency Pocket Guide include illustrations to help the reader better understand the topic. Several of the glossary entries have detailed, informative drawings.

It only takes a few minutes to become familiar with the structure of this guide, and topics are very easy to find. The information in each section is useful and factual, making this a great handbook for pet owners of all experience levels. I found the Pet Emergency Pocket Guide to be very thorough and informative. I would recommend it for any pet owner who would like a convenient emergency and pet care reference. This guide also make a great gift for pet lovers and an excellent product for new pet owners. Plus, at a price of $16.95, I'd call it a pretty good deal.
