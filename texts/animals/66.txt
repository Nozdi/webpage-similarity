Any dog lover can tell you that dogs sleep. Along with running, playing and eating, our dogs love to catch a few winks throughout the day. Some dogs will just crash anywhere, but most look for the soft comfort of a dog bed or even your own bed. Of course, everyone knows that sleeping dogs are adorable - and sometimes quite funny, too. Take a break and check out some seriously cute pictures of napping dogs. Then consider submitting your own photos of snoozing dogs for this gallery.
