My Jaspurr has had diarrhea problems for well over a month, though Giardia has been ruled out twice. Lately though, I'd noticed lying near the litter box and elsewhere on the carpet, small pieces of poop which took on the shape of cats anal glands. I couldn't help but mention anal gland impaction as a possible connectiion to his diarrhea.

A cat's anal glands are one of his/her most effective means of communication, but like other organs, they are sometimes subject to problems. A regular check of your cat's body from head to toe can often detect potential problems before they become emergencies. Jaspurr's veterinarian examined his butt end thorougly, and since the anal sacs were full, she cleaned them out. He feels much better, I'm sure, but the diarrhea mystery has yet to be resolved. We'll presently working on his diet right now, and he has received a few cans of I/D for starters.
