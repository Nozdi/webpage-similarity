Figuring out cat behavior can be a real puzzle, sometimes. Cat Behavior 101 was created to help cat caregivers understand why cats do not always behave the way we expect them to, and to help them change those practices to more acceptable behavior.

Behavioral problems in cats, such as avoiding the litterbox, excessive meowing and other attention-seeking behavior, biting and painful or destructive scratching can be corrected by first eliminating physical causes, then initiating a program of gradual retraining, with the help of these resources. Remember that there are no bad cats, only uninformed cat caregivers.
