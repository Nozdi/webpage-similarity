Deep in the icy, snow-packed woods of Siberia, tigers prowl. It's an odd place to envision tigersâ€”majestic and black-striped, these felines are more often associated with the humid jungles of India than with the wintry stretches of eastern Russia. But this is no ordinary tiger, this is the Siberian tiger (Panthera tigris altaica). Siberian tigers are a critically endangered subspecies of tiger that once roamed the wilds of Russia, China, Mongolia, and the Korean Peninsula. Today, they inhabit small remnants of their former range. They have disappeared entirely from South Korea and survive only in small numbers in North Korea and China.
