A friend of mine has a 13 year-old daughter who is a cat-sitter for neighbors. She charges a small daily fee, and goes after school to do her homework with the cats. While she is there, she feeds the cats, refills their water dishes changes the litter box, and then plays with them. A bonus is that she takes photos and videos on her cell phone and sends them to the cats' owners. A teen who drives could even take cats for routine vet visits.

This would also be a good opportunity for a senior who could not have a cat. It would provide cat companionship, earn a little pocket money while helping out a neighbor, and provide wonderful "purr therapy."

For others, it could lead to part or full-time work as a licensed, bonded pet sitter.
