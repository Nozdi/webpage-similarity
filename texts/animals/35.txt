Have you ever had an accident or injury injury because of your dog, whether directly or indirectly? The CDC reports on fall-related injuries involving pets, stating that "the most frequent circumstances were falling or tripping over a dog (31.3%) and being pushed or pulled by a dog (21.2%). Falling over a pet item (e.g., a toy or food bowl) accounted for 8.8% of fall injuries." These types of accidents can be frightening, tragic or even funny. Read stories from other pet owners who have had a dog-related accident or injury. If you have an interesting story of your own to tell, we would love to hear it.
