Panthers, or members of the Genus Panthera, also called 'roaring cats', include lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars. Although among the best known species in the cat family, the roaring cats can be easily confused due to similarities in their coats. But armed with a few facts, you can quickly narrow down the possibilities when trying to place a name with a cat.

Of all the cats, jaguars and leopards are the most often confused. Their markings are very similar but they have different statures and slightly different rosettes. To distinguish between the two species, examine the rosette pattern. Jaguars have spots in the center of the rosette while leopards do not have spots inside the rosettes. Another (perhaps easier) way to distinguish between them is by their distribution. Jaguars inhabit South and Central America while leopards inhabit Africa and Asia.
