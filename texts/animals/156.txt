 "This is Mongo, my now five year old foundling. Since my sliding patio doors are always open in nice weather and I have other kitties, he decided to join us when he was about three or four months old. He was on his own for a while and that is probably what makes him a little skittish most of the time, but he can also be very loving and demanding with his little head butts to get me to rub him...but only on his terms."
