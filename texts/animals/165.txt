A recent study involving 147 cities around the world has revealed that urban areas can support a surprisingly diverse collection of species. This seems counterintuitiveâ€”conventional wisdom suggests that urban areas cause widespread loss of biodiversity. Although conversion of natural areas to cities does impact the wildlife of the region, it is encouraging to find out that some species do adapt and that cities develop their own fauna that is a unique reflection of their geographic location.

The study was conducted by a team of scientists from UC Santa Barabara and was funded by the National Science Foundation. The findings of the study suggest that although urban development causes a large amount of species loss in terms of both plants and animals, some endemic species prevail in the altered landscape.

Scientists found that parks within cities often provide much needed resources for wildlife. This means that by optimizing green space in cities and by putting forth sound conservation policies for urban environments, urban biodiversity can be better protected and bolstered.
