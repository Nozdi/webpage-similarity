No Sour Puss Here

 "Think Like a Cat" is not just a cute title. In fact, people who are the most successful in raising happy, healthy, cats are those who have become attuned to their cats' signals, those who have learned how to think like a cat. A tall order, you might say, but one with rewards beyond imagination. Pam Johnson-Bennett takes us through a magical tour of the cat's world, from a primer on the parts of a cat (how and why they work), to an in-depth discussion of diseases and maladies that can befall a cat, from the mundane fleas to the more serious feline leukemia. There are few questions about raising cats that are not answered somewhere in this book, and you'll likely find yourself thinking like a cat for answers to those.
