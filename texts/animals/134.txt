He is just the cutest kitty ever. He loves to get in small places for a quick nap. He's a real sweetheart. He loves to be cuddled and played with. I've owned lots of cats in my life, but Sammy is the most adorable one. My 4 years old granddaughter loves to sit and talk to him. He has become her best friend. They show each other lots of love and attention.
