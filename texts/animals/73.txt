Lucy was a survivor of a huge fire in a city about two hours away, and was originally adopted by a lady who hoped to be over her allergies to cats. However, that didn't turn out to be the case, so Magdalena, who had never had a cat before, offered to foster her for her friend, until she could find a new home. I'm sure you guessed what happened to that short-term fostering idea. Yep, Lucy had chosen Magdalena's place as her forever home. It was written in the stars. Read the rest of Lucy's story on her own personal page in the Tuxedo Cats Show and Tell.
