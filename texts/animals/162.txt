Fuzzy Nuts ( called Pud Cat in public ) was a big , friendly, orange tom-cat. Having been raised with dogs I was totally clueless about cats ! He came inside to eat and take afternoon naps and play with us in the evenings but went back outside each night to "do cat things". He liked barbeque potato chips, would come when we snapped our fingers and was friendly with our dog. The two of them would play together outside and the neighbors would come out to watch the cat "chase" the dog ( Pud was actually chasing Rusty's leash ). He did teach us that when a cat lays belly up it is NOT an invitation to rub his tummy ! But we took no offense - we fell for "The Trap" over and over again ! He was loving without being "needy" and even though he retained his independence it was clear that he valued our friendship as much as we valued his. I don't think we realized how much a part of the family he had become until he was gone for a few days and returned very ill. Fortunately he didn't suffer long. The day the vet called to tell me that Fuzzy Nuts did not survive my son also called to report that he and his dad had found a tiny calico kitten all alone on a job site - and asked if they could bring her home. What a bittersweet day ! At least the death of Fuzzy Nuts taught us the importance of keeping cats indoors ( and spay/neuter ) so the calico kitten became the first of our indoor only cats and she lived a healthy risk-free 20 years.
