Mothers Day is today, and again I'll celebrate it as I have every year since my own Mom passed away: by donating to a local cat rescue for the spay/neuter of a rescued cat.

My heart breaks when I get emails from proud cat owners about their cats' new litters of kittens, knowing that for every kitten they'll give away "free to a good home," a shelter cat may lose its life. (And knowing that those "free kittens" may not fare so well.)

My heart fills with sorrow and anger when I hear the phrase, "My cat got herself pregnant," because the blame rightfully belongs to the ignorant person who failed to spay the cat, then allowed her to roam free. And I'm sickened by the knowledge that one day this person will likely either dump the cat and her kittens at an animal shelter, or abandon them on the street as the cats pictured above, or if they're "lucky," in a park, where they will have to fend for themselves along with other abandoned and feral cats.

Happy Mothers Day to all the Moms of both human and fur-bearing kids! And if you have a female cat or kitten, please do the kind, responsible thing by having her spayed at your earliest opportunity. They deserve nothing less.
