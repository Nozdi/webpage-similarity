All children should be taught to respect other living beings, be they animal or human. From birth, children need to learn that some things are just not allowed, and "be gentle" should be a common household command. Even if your household does not contain animals, your children should still be taught the basics. One day they will encounter an animal, whether it is somebody else's pet in a controlled environment, or a meeting on the street with a strange dog.Parents, please don't hesitate to call animal control if a loose dog ever threatens you or your child. Loose dogs are a menace, and irresponsible owners should be held accountable. Dog owners that do not care where their dog goes and what he does should not be dog owners, period.
