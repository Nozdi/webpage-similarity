Czar has always been a very gentle and caring dog. He loves people young and old, he also loves to snuggle. Czar is not a service dog, but has helped to calm children after nightmares and when my husband has been sick. He is in poor health now and we are in danger of losing him.

My niece and her baby used to live with us to the time the baby was 2. When the little girl was about 1 she started having night terrors. We would bring her downstairs and put her favorite dvd on and sit on the floor trying to calm her and stop her from crying and screaming. Czar would come out of my room and snuggle up close to her and kiss her until she calmed down enough to lay down again, at which time he would lay with her and she would pet him and hold onto him. They would just lay this way until she finally fell back to sleep and slept the rest of the night. He loved that child very much and protected her.
