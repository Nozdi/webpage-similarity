If you haven't already planned to keep all the kittens from the litter, you'll need to start thinking about placing them in permanent loving homes when they are eight to twelve weeks old. You will want to find potential adopters for your kittens who will love, care for, and appreciate them as much as you do.

There are a number of positive things you can do to help ensure the people you are entrusting your kittens to will be responsible cat parents.

If a prospect looks good so far, consider asking for a home visit, so you can see if they are equipped to care for a cat. If they have very young toddlers, or large dogs, a kitten might not fare well there.

If this cat was a stray, or your first experience at fostering a pregnant cat, by now, you are well on your way to becoming an expert. Take a break or look for the next cat to foster. But before that, you still have one thing left to accomplish: Spay the mother cat if it has not already been done.
