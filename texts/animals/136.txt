sammy is very curious, always playing with his furblings. he loves to practice his coordination skills by batting hair ties and mousies under the stove and refridgerator and hides his mousies under the couch. he gives great sandpaper kisses..

sammy lived on a farm, the lasst of the litter. i spoke with a woman whose ragdoll was having kittens and i expressed interest in having a male kitten.

he has a very distinct face..with startling blue eyes and a look of curiosity about him all the time.

he loves anything that moves, loves to chase balls and hair ties and bats his hair ties and mousies under the stove and refridgerator.

he likes a challenge..he loves to jump up on the counters and the refridgerator and the shelf above..

he knows his name. he loves to meet new people and greets them at the door.

he will lay on your chest and give you sweet sandpaper kisses. he will watch t.v.
