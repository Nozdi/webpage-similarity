n. "A group of dolphins that live in the major rivers of the world, including the Amazon in Brazil, the Ganges in India, the Yangtze in China, and the Irrawady in Myanmar, to name a few. These dolphins are relatively unknown because of their shyness, small numbers, and geographical locations, and it is only in recent years that worldwide attention has focused on their situation. It is regrettable to note that their populations are declining due to the hunting, destruction, and pollution that characterize their habitats." (Source: Dor)
