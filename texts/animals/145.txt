What are your kitten's most appealing traits? Purring champion when snuggled....plays with all the other pets (three dogs, two other cats...oh, yes, and two parrots, who do NOT play with him!)

How I Came to Meet This Kitten He and his identical brother were available from the owner of the kennel where I have my cairn terrier groomed. I held each twice, and both times, Hamish purred and the other didn't....purred himself right into a loving home!

Why I Think my Kitten is the Cutest Kitten Well, who can resist a feisty red kitten with a good Scottish name! He challenges all comers to a run and wrestle, charms birds at the feeder from the safety of a wide windowsill, but is kept inside to protect the local wildlife, including the deer. He is a full entertainment package, plus a lap warmer par excellence....AND he purrs! What more could anyone want?
