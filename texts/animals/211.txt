A recent study by TRAFFIC, the World Wildlife Fund, and the International Snow Leopard Trust has revealed a sharp decline in the snow leopard population. Snow leopards live in the mountains of central and southern Asia. They inhabit scrublands and grasslands that occur at altitudes between 2000m and 6000m. The research revealed that hunting throughout their range was the main cause of the observed population decline. Snow leopards (Panthera uncia) are targeted for their pelts, for use in traditional medicines, and in retaliation for killing livestock.

Scientists estimate that there are fewer than 4,000 to 7,000 individuals left worldwide and the species is on the decline. The snow leopard belongs to the Genus Panthera, a group that includes lions, jaguars, tigers, and leopards. The snow leopard has a broad, round head and strong paws. It is well adapted for the cold climates it lives in, with long fur covering its body and even the bottoms of its feet (thus providing insulation when it walks through the snow). In winter, it's coat is grayish white with brown or black spots. In summer, the snow leopard's coat warms to a yellowish brown color, again with black spots.

Despite local and international laws banning the trade of snow leopard pelts and bones, instances of illegal trade has been found in all of the countries where the cats live, with the exception of Bhutan.

A disturbing trend was discovered in Afganistan. Research found that Western military personnel and aid personnel stationed in Afghanistan may be the reason for an increased demand for snow leopard pelts. The United Nations Environment Program made an assessment after military conflict and found that Afghanistan may have as few as 100 to 200 snow leopards left. Because leopard pelts bring up to $1000 in Kabul, it's tempting for people to hunt the endangered cat and sell its hide for a profit.
