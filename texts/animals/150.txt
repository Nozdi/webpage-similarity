Grain-free cat food is Meaningless marketing. Canned and dry. Instead of grains as filler, all but a very few brands, replace the grain with starch, which is just as species inappropriate and potentially disease causing as grain.

Wysong makes The ONLY Grain-Free-STARCH FREE kibble on the market.

It's dry. Even the Epigen website will tell you kibble isn't ideal.

My cats love it. Because it is dry, I use it sparingly, as a healthier alternative to packaged cat treats.

Wysong is the only company that has devised a way to make kibble without the starches needed, and used, to bind all other brands of kibble. Epigen comes in a 60% meat & organ formula, and a 90% meat & organ formula. Epigen 60 is comparable in price with other brands of premium kibble.

Because Epigen contains the taurine that cats need, it can be fed to both dogs and cats.

The Epigen line of dry food is the only dry food I feed now.

I've used Wysong Epigen 60, then 90, to wean each of my 3 rescue cats off the corn laden kibble they were eating in the shelter, when they didn't transition easily to canned food,

Each one became leaner, more active and shed less within a month.
