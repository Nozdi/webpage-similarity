My neighbor was giving away kittens, I got another one from her last year and unfortunately she was hit by a car, her name was courtarina after my 2 daughters named katarina and courtney now we have our mimi and we love her just as much she is so human she loves to give kisses

She has the cutest little pink nose and she has this stuffed animal we call ducky that she plays with all the time and when she is done playing with ducky she puts her away with some other toys that she plays with. She loves to give kisses and take baths. She also follows me around the house when I am in the kitchen cooking she sits on a stool and watches when I am in the shower she sits on the toilet and waits until I am done or she justs comes in with me. She also loves to play hide and seek and for me to chase her. And of cource she is just one of the family. She sleeps on her back and loves her belly scratched.
