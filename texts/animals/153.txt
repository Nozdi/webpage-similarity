Punkin', female, was less than 2 months old when I got her.

Her personality is her most appealing trait. She's a lover and a lap kitty. Whenever I sit in my recliner, she has to be in my lap and falls asleep as long as I sit there. I use a walker at home and Punkin' loves to ride on the seat. Then, she falls asleep on the seat if I sit somewhere else.

While I was at the shelter, I'd choosen a little white kitten and then, Punkin' walked out from behind another kitten in another cage and soon as I saw her, I knew I had to have her, too. Needless to say, they both came home with me. When I had her spayed, the vet said she weighed only 1.1 pounds.

She has a kind of bob tail except it's not as short as you might believe and her tail has blossomed into a little fluffy fur ball. Her legs are so fluffy, too, they appear to have furry bloomers on when she walks away from you.

She's almost all orange in color with the exception of little patches of white on her tummy and a white mask around her orange eyes.
