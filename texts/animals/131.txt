We started feeding his mother and she worked her way into our home and lives then fell apart and presented us with five darling boy kittens. I wanted to keep them all but was not able to do that so we found all but one of them good homes.

Violet is the living definition of cute and adorable. I mean look at that face! Could anything be cuter? He loves to come join me in bed and cuddle right up with me; during the day he follows me around. And whenever I sit down he is right there to make sure I don't get lonely.
