The Conscious Cat is dedicated to conscious living, health and happiness for cats and their humans.

I'm passionate about feline health, and as a former veterinary hospital manager turned writer, I was looking for a platform to share my knowledge with cat owners. I love being able to provide cat parents with the information they need to ensure that their cats have the best life possible.

I love being a part of the community of pet bloggers.
