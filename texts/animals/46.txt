I am a retired female with a Designer Mutt (suppose to be a real designer dog). His name is Raffee after Rafael Nadal the tennis player. He is blond, weighs 20 lbs, is 2 years old and full of life and love to share with all.

I drive Raffee to the rehab center every Tuesday where he brings lots of smiles to all ages of people there. He helps the patients by letting them feed him treats which helps with their coordination and motor skills. He also visits the Children's Unit where he does numerous tricks to brings giggles, claps and praise from his young admirers. He is always ready to go, wears a huge grin on his face the entire time and patiently lets the children pull his tail and play with his feet and ears. Raffee is one remarkable mutt.

I went to a dog therapy training class for 8 weeks, was observed 3 times by professionals and he passed a test. Then we were insured, up to date on all shots for both Raffee and his driver, got approved by the hospitals and we were given our assignments.

The result is a wonderful experience every week as we meet new people, make new friends and bring lots of smiles and enjoyment to the patients and staff workers each week. Of course, Raffee has the most fun.
