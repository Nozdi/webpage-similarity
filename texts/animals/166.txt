In 1974, Wally and Marion Paton, a couple living in the town of Patagonia in the southeast corner of Arizona, decided to make a few modifications to their yard to attract migrating birds. The Patons planted some flowers, installed several water features, and hung a dozen or more hummingbird feeders. Their efforts were rewarded. More than 15 species of hummingbirds began to visit their property and the Patons soon realized that fellow birdwatchers were gathering outside their yard to get a view of the birds.

The Patons generously welcomed visiting birdwatchers. For more than three decades they received visitors from around the world who wanted to come and see the hummingbirds for themselves. The Patons installed a tent for visiting birders, installed seating areas and provided assistance in identifying the birds in their garden. They accepted donations to help cover the cost of feeding the hummingbirds.

Now, the Paton property has been passed on to their children and the new generation wanted to ensure the area remain preserved for both birds birdwatchers in years to come. The family recently sold the land to the American Bird Conservancy and it will be looked after by the Tucson Audubon Society. This wonderful birding location will remain a haven for migrating birds and birders hoping to glimpse rarely-seen species such as the plain-capped starthroat, the violet-crowned hummingbird, and the magnificent hummingbird.
