I heard Crisiska calling to me. She'd been abandoned at a pet store who couldn't legally sell her. An employee there had offered to take it with her to find her a home. She found me at the train station on her way home.It was cold and windy on the way back to my house, and I was walking along a big scary main road by night. I was concerned for her, and slipped her under my jumper, making sure the top was loose enough to breathe, she'd stick the tip of her nose out from time to time to sniff, so cute. She purred and curled up next to my heart, and really never left there.
