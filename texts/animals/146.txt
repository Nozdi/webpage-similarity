He LOVED people. He would throw himself onto your lap anywhere...couch, bed, toilet...didn't matter to him. He also loved to perch on our shoulders and just hang there while we were working on the computer or doing dishes. If necessary he would climb right up our pants and shirt to get there.

A female cat that I adopted had a litter of kittens. We decided to keep two of them and he was one of the two. He was one of two in the litter that looked like him and I originally thought I wanted to keep the other one but decided to leave it up to which one's I could adopt out. In the end, when the other family picked his sister, I ended up being thrilled because he had so endeared himself to me!

He was vocally very quiet and loved to just sit and stare at you, happily blinking away. Although he was quiet, you generally knew where he was because he was also QUITE clumsy! I tend to have a cluttered environment and pretty much everywhere he went he would send things tumbling...often himself.

In addition to his most appealing traits, he was this gorgeous dark brown color with white whiskers and individual white hairs scattered about strategically like highlights. He was fluffy and had a way of always looking windblown, without being tangled or dirty. He also loved our dog, Maxi, and would often snuggle up to her, much to her curiosity.

Even when he got sick and we had him in the vet's office, he climbed up on her shoulder and hung out after being listless most of the night. The next day he ended up in the emergency room. They treated through the weekend but continued to decline...they think it was a liver shunt.
