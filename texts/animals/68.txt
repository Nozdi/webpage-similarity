A full-grown Maine Coon can be an armful; males can reach as much as 25 pounds, females somewhat less, although the average is 12 to 15 pounds for males and 9 to 12 pounds for females. On average, it takes three to four years for the "Coon" to reach its full size. It's sweet disposition and large size combine fittingly for the Coon's nickname, "Gentle Giant."
