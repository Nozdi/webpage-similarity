How I met my first cat We live near the edge of town in a small town in Iowa, and there are feral cats in the area. One of them deposited 4 kittens under our deck. Eventually two of the kittens died, and the mother mostly disappeared. One day we caught up with one of the survivors in the back yard. He was hungry and trying to meow, but no sound was coming out. We brought him indoors, fed him, and named him Larry because he kind of had laryngitis.

How this cat wormed its way into my heart Larry had a bad case of fleas, so the vet told me to try a couple of drops of Frontline. I did that and held the kitty on my lap, catching fleas as they tried to leap to safety. Larry looked up at me with grateful blue eyes, and I was totally in love! Eventually we caught his sister, a gray tortie (both are long haired) and brought her indoors to stay. Her name is officially Louise, but we always call her Weezy. Then the others had an easy time worming their way into our hearts!
