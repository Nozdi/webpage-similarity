Question: Why do cats sometimes act so crazy?

Why do all cats, doesn't matter the breeds, all of a sudden out of nowhere run across a room, meowing like a nut, 50 miles an hour, meowing or crying again and again, darting faster and looking around all over the place then stopping?

I have to get hysterical with laughter when they all do that! I just never know when it will happen and do all cats do it?
