Your kitten's first year is the most important one, in terms of his physical development as well as the human-feline bonding you will accomplish, which will mold his personality. These are months to cherish, as they pass by all too quickly.

It has been mentioned before that kittens are not simply miniature cats. Their development into adult cats is a fascinating process, and each step of the way a kitten is in a unique place in life. The wise caregiver will recognize this fact and use it to understand what your kitten is experiencing, as well as what his actions are telling you.

Even the most jaded person loves seeing photos of adorable kittens. I know that you must be very proud of yours and will be taking loads of photos as he or she grows. Share a photo or two with my readers, and help your kitten gain the fame he deserves.
