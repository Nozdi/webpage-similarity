New research reveals that the way polar bears conserve energy and generate body heat differs from their cousins, the brown bears and the black bears. Brown and black bears hibernate during the cold winter months. This enables them to save energy and tolerate the cold without having to sustain activity throughout the harshest months. In contrast, most polar bears remain active throughout the winter (only pregnant females retreat into the shelter of dens during the winter). This means that polar bears must power movement and generate sufficient body heat to cope with frigid temperatures.

A team of scientists led by Charlotte Lindqvist, a biologist and assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, have now discovered an underlying genetic mechanism that might explain how polar bears are able to cope with cold temperatures. The research team found that polar bears have unique gene variations that influence the way in which polar bears make use of nitric oxide.

Nitric oxide is thought to play a key role in determining how nutrients are used by the body. When cells transform food into energy, it is thought that nitric oxide may act as a trigger in determining whether energy from food is stored as fat or burned to generate heat. In polar bears, it is thought that nitric oxide activity tends towards the production of heat (instead of storing energy as fat). This means that polar bears are better suited for staying warm in cold temperatures. Brown and black bears, by comparison, store food as fat which they burn slowly to sustain themselves throughout their hiberation.
