Losing a pet is a sad and stressful situation for everyone - including the other dogs in the household. If you are dealing with the death of one of your dogs, there are several things you can do to help your remaining dog through the difficult time.

Just like people, all dogs react differently to loss. Here are some common dog reactions to the death of another dog:

No matter how your dog reacts to the loss of another dog, chances are he's feeling stress over the changes in the household. One of best ways you can help him adjust to the loss is to stick as carefully as possible to his normal routine. Continue feeding him and walking him at the same times. Sticking to his usual schedule can help a great deal in reducing his stress.

Chances are the dog that passed away played a large role in the day-to-day life of your other dog. They may have played together or napped together. Losing this may leave the remaining dog feeling bored and anxious. You can help your dog deal with the boredom and anxiety by providing him with more exercise and mental stimulation. Some things you can do include going for an extra walk each day, providing plenty of interesting toys, starting an obedience program, and playing extra games of fetch or tug-of-war.





One of the first pieces of advice many people hear when they lose their dog is to run right out and get another one. Before you get another dog, there are some things you should consider.
