The Grenada dove (Leptotila wellsi) is set to lose a large portion of its dry-forest habitat as plans take shape to build a luxury hotel in what is now Grenada's Mount Hartman National Park. The Grenada Government is preparing to sell off the national park to the Four Seasons Hotels and Resort Group who intend to construct a 150-room hotel, 300 luxury villas, and a golf course on the site. The Mount Hartman National Park, also called 'The Dove Sanctuary', is located in the southwest region of Grenada. It was established as a nature sanctuary in 1996 and was created as a means to compensate for habitat destruction elsewhere on the island. It currently supports 20 pairs of Grenada doves, one quarter of the worldwide population.
