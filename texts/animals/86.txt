It's always sad to hear of a cat being tossed out because of uncontrollable biting and/or scratching behavior. While this aggressive kind of behavior is painful and frustrating to deal with, try to remember that cats never do anything without a reason. They are actually very predictable creatures, and biting and scratching are cause and effect behaviors just as most undesirable behaviors. There are two basic kinds of biting and scratching behaviors in cats, and both of them are often originally caused by our own human failings. I'll explain more about this later. But for now, remember that biting and scratching are perfectly normal behaviors.

Kittens learn biting and scratching as an important part of their development. After all, these activities are cats' only means of defense, as well as their natural way of killing prey in the wild. Cats' main form of play involves biting and scratching in "winner takes all" battles, whether with another cat, a toy mouse, or a hapless human who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

One of the first rules for human companions is "do not teach your cat that hands are toys." If you ignore this advice, those tiny claws and teeth will soon grow into razor-sharp "meat hooks," and you'll bear the scars of your hubris.
