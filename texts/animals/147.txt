The county Humane Society had her at the local PetSmart store. I happened to walk by and there was an instant bond. Our eyes met. I said no to myself and went home. The next day I went back and and had her taken out so I could hold her, she was 5 months at the time. I called my husband (since we have another adopted cat in the house) and asked if I could bring her home. After all the other cat is overweight and this kitten would inspire him to exercise and play. My husband caved in.
