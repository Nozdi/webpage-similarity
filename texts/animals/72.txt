After reading Lucy's amazing story, it was impossible for me to bypass her for the Cat Picture of the Week distinction.

Lucy's adoption by Magdalena was a bit of serendipity that some movies are made of. Lucy had survived a huge fire, and a friend of Magdalena's had decided to foster her until a permanent home could be found. However, her allergies quashed that idea, so Magdalena agreed to be a surrogate foster for her friend, although she had never had a cat before. You've seen Lucy's photo, and her personality is every bit as winning as her beauty. Read more of Lucy's story and learn how you can submit your own tuxedo cat's photos and story.
