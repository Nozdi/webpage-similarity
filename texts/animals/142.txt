** MamaBoo ** our Beautiful Black Female who adopted us about four years ago. We believe she is about 4 years old...might have been born in the late Spring of 2007.

Black cats have a wonderful way of standing out above all others. Thru the years they seem to have their own stories ... mostly in the Autumn season they are talked about the most. But I feel during the month of December they really show their true being with the red or white, green or purple that seem to go so well with their color. They really show up as a beauty of nature.
