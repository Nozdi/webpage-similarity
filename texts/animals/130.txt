He is naughty & cheeky but very sweet & gentle all at the same time.

After losing our beloved Persian Boris, we were looking for another sweet boy to fill the void. This beautiful exotic boy was offered to us & we jumped at the chance to have him join our family.

Well firstly you just have to look at the picture...he is utterly adorable.

I think what makes him particularly cute though, is how he can be so naughty & yet somehow appear really sweet while doing so. He does something naughty & all I want to do is kiss him.

I love the way when he drinks his bowl of milk (he has a serious cat milk habit!) he always has a bit left over for later..
