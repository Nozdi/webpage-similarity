It's an easily observable fact that cats quickly groom their coats when faced with stressful situations, embarrassment at having committed a cat blunder, such as knocking over a stool with a clumsy jump. However when the grooming continues long after the stressful situation is over, it enters the realm of psychogenic alopecia, as described here by Amy Shojai, CABC.

Amy covers everything from diagnosis to treatment, along with things you can do to lessen your cats' stress, which leads to psychogenic alopecia.
