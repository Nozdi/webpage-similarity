Question: I'm a new father, but my ex-girlfriend wants nothing to do with me and won't even let me see my son. How do I get a visitation order through the courts? I'm not the kind of guy who can just walk away, but I don't know what to do. It sounds like fathers' rights are very limited in the real world, especially for unmarried dads like me. Answer: First, I think it's great that you're not walking away. You and your son have a right to know one another and establish a loving, life-long relationship. However, the fact that you and your ex-girlfriend never married means that right now, she has the upper hand, legally. While some states require unmarried moms to actually file for custody, most states presume that an unmarried mother has primary custody whether she files for custody in court or not. So what does this mean for you? My advice is to be realistic about your expectations. Unless the mother is truly unfit to care for your son, it's unlikely that you'll be awarded primary physical custody. But its entirely reasonable for you to have a regular, ongoing visitation schedule. Since you've indicated that your ex-girlfriend refuses to allow you to spend time with your son at this point, you'll need to pursue visitation through the proper legal channels: Remember, too, that your initial visitation plan is something that will likely change over time as your son grows older. Right now, because he is so young, frequent, short visits that take place around his existing nap schedule will give you both the best opportunity to bond and establish a relationship with one another. As he gets older, those visits may become less frequent but longer. Keeping your long-range goals in mind as you go through this process can help you stay calm and focused, even when you face opposition and delays.
