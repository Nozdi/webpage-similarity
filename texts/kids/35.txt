The main thing to remember when cooking pork tenderloins is not to overcook when roasting, since overcooking will cause the meat to dry out and toughen. It's a good idea to use a meat thermometer to test for doneness; cutting into the meat to test for color will cause too many good juices to run out. Cook pork tenderloin to a temperature of at least 145Â° F., as recommended by the USDA. This should produce tenderloin that's juicy, tender, and safe. Since tenderloin is often somewhat higher in price, look for sales and stock up! Fresh pork may be kept frozen from 3 to 6 months.
