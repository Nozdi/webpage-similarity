Any brand of cake mix will work just fine in these recipes, as long as the net weight of the mix is the same as that called for in the recipes. Some cake mixes make only a single layer cake; these recipes all call for two-layer cake mixes. 
 As long as you stick pretty closely to the basic recipe, you can change the flavor of almost all of these desserts. Substitute white chocolate chips for dark chocolate. Add maple flavoring instead of vanilla. Use a different flavor canned pie filling, or a different type of jam or jelly. 
 And these recipes are really wonderful ways to get your kids in the kitchen; with less mess (hopefully) and a lot of fun. 
You can even Make Your Own Cake Mix to control what your family is eating. Use 3-1/2 cups of this homemade mix in place of a two layer cake mix. 
 Make a couple of these recipes for desserts this week. They're a great way to add a special touch to the simplest lunch or dinner.
