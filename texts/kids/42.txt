Do you know where your Abs are? If not, it might have something to do with gravity. Think for a moment about abdominal exercises.  Most of us instantly think of crunches or some other move done lying on your back. While there is value in those exercises, research has shown that the the most effective abdominal strengthening exercise available is, (drum roll please) the plank. Yes, it's true. Before I ask you to do anything like a Plank - I'd like to show you how you can really, truly find your abdominal muscles and experience how you can turn them on in a plank - or any other exercise you decide to tackle. Let's start simply - lie on your back for a moment and notice that gravity places a natural weight on your body.  With gravity bearing down on you in this position, your abdominals are generally pulled inward.  Take a few deep breaths here and see how your stomach only rises and falls in a small limited way. Performing Ab work in this position can be quite effective but isn't the easiest way to on your back and you'll understand quickly why it's so difficult to feel your six pack most of the time. Now let's get to the real discovery process. I've been using this method for years with great success with athletes, new exercisers and post-partum women. Follow me down the rabbit hole.
