Child support payments are calculated differently depending on where you live.  Here are some of the most common questions parents ask about child support payments: Statistically, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average child support award is $445 per month, or $5,350 per year.  However, many families receive far less than this, or nothing at all. Child support is calculated differently depending on where you live.  Some states use what is known as the "Income Shares Model" for calculating child support, which means that they take into consideration the adjusted gross income of both parents.  Other states look only at the income of the parent who is being asked to pay child support.  Fortunately, many states now make their child support calculators available online. Depending on where you live, child support payments may be reduced according to the amount of parenting time each parent is awarded.  This is because it is generally understood that the obligor is taking care of the child's needs while he or she is with the child. References:
