Because the cut is so lean, tenderloin should be cooked quickly. If you cut a tenderloin into rounds or medallions, it will cook in minutes on a dual-contact indoor grill. Each tenderloin usually weighs about 1 to 1-1/4 pounds. Pork is cooked in minutes per pound. So roast a tenderloin at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes per pound and grill it over medium coals for 15-25 minutes per pound. The internal temperature should be a minimum of 145 degrees F (the USDA lowered the safe temperature for pork in the summer of 2011).
 One of the quickest meals in the market starts with a marinated pork tenderloin. Several companies produce this product. Just cook and eat! But you can save some money and control sodium by marinating a plain tenderloin yourself.
