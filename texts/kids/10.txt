Before
even considering a raccoon though, be aware that they are illegal in many
areas. Check with local and state/provincial regulatory bodies
before pursuing the idea of having a raccoon as a pet. If raccoons
are legal where you are, then the search is on. It is best
to obtain them from a breeder, although one may be difficult to find.
Some have raised orphan
raccoons as pets. In any case, it is best if the raccoons are very
used to being handled, a lot and from an early age. This will help
make them more sociable and less prone to bite. Raccoons are
prone to biting, especially if they feel threatened, so be prepared that
this may happen.
 Be prepared to make a commitment to a raccoon. They need lots
of care and attention, as well as supervision. If well cared
for it is reasonable to expect them to live for 10-15 years, so the commitment
is not to be taken lightly. You need to consider who can look after
the raccoon if you must go away, of if something should happen that means
you cannot keep the raccoon. They can't go back to wild living once
being used to the pet life! For a good perspective on the commitment,

 Also find a veterinarian who will treat a raccoon. Even where
raccoons are legal it may be difficult to find a vet who is willing to
deal with them. Raccoons are susceptible to distemper and rabies.
Although they can be vaccinated with killed rabies vaccine, in the case
of a human bite incident, regulatory agencies most likely will not accept the vaccine as effective and confiscate your raccoon. Be careful!
 With all that out of the way, we can look at the world of raccoons and
see what sort of pets they can be.
