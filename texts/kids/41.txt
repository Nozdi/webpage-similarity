Can sand or beans make your upper body stronger? Absolutely. They say necessity is the mother of invention and Joseph Pilates was certainly familiar with that feeling.  Tales abound of Joe's "back room" at his original 8th avenue studio in New York City where he would not only work with clients who had special needs but also tinker away at new equipment.  One of the smaller and perhaps less often used devices to come out of Joe's shop is the bean bag.  If you want to build arm and wrist strength as well as wrist and finger mobility, the bean bag is extremely effective. Fashioned from a simple dowel, some string and a bag filled with beans or sand, you can purchase a Pilates bean bag from several manufacturers. Alternatively you can make your own using one to two bags of dried beans or sand as the filler and a simple canvas sack. In the digital age our hands and fingers and wrists lose articulation.  We use our hands primarily for typing now which places both the fingers and the wrists in a limited range of motion. For many, the ability to do weight bearing upper body exercises is negatively impacted. Fortunately, there is a lot you can do about it and it doesn't have to be complicated. Use this simple standing exercise and a Pilates beanbag to restore and improve function, mobility and strength in your fingers, wrists and forearms. With consistent practice your planks and push ups will be completely reborn. Read on for Step One.
