Creating a better sex life requires not only sexual action but sexual reflection. Use the ideas and questions below to guide you in reflecting on lesson eight of the online course 9 Weeks to Better Sex.

This exercise asks you to reflect privately on how you and your partner deal with sexual problems in your relationship. As you think about the questions below, don't worry about whether or not you're going to share this with your partner. If you can each complete the exercise and then share your answers that would be great, but it's not necessary for the exercise to be valuable.

There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. They are meant to start you thinking only, not to evaluate your thoughts or feelings.
