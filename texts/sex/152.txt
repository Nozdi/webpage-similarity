According to a new national survey by the Canadian Association for Adolescent Health, teenagers may be listening much more than parents think when it comes to getting answers to questions about sex and sexual health. In a prepared release, CAAH spokesperson and pediatrician at the Adolescent Division at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto Miriam Kaufman said:

One of the most surprising results of the study was how parents underestimate their importance and the role teens expect them to play when it comes to their sexuality and sexual health. Canadian teens look up to their parents and consider them a valuable source of information. We are hoping that by making this information widely known, parents will feel more comfortable breaking the wall of silence that too often exists when it comes to discussing sexuality with their children."

63% of teens surveyed considered their parents a major source of information, and 43% thought parents were the most useful and valuable source of information.

The survey also revealed important gaps in teen knowledge and practice of safer sex:

The survey also revealed interesting differences in how these teens define sex. For example, 68% of sexually active teens have engaged in oral sex, and 26% of teens consider sexual abstinence to include oral sex.

While the numbers of teens engaging in sex may be alarming to some, the survey, which also collected information from mothers of teens, found that parents may overestimate the amount of sex teens are having, mothers who were also surveyed overestimating by 50 per cent the number of teenagers engaged in sexual activity.
