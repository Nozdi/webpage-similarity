What I struggled with most I developed slower than my classmates in High School. While they had hair and were walking around the locker rooms sporting 'man sized parts' I was still small and hairless. Boys can be very cruel. I later found out that supposed men can be just as cruel. When I finally did develop no one in the locker room is going to re-adjust and say holy s@#$ to change a person's perception.

What made me work on it I was nervous when I had sex for the first time. I was afraid that my girlfriend and future wife would laugh at me. I put off sex for a long time and it almost cost me my wife of 19 years. When we did have sex I discovered that she enjoyed it as much as I did. She actually asked me to be easy that I was larger than she was used to.

If I could say one thing to others about penis size now Just as different men have different sized penises women come in many sizes also. In our society it is easy to 'shop around' for a perfect fit. That does not mean just for sex. Find someone who matches your interests, goals and life style. Develop a relationship based on quality.
