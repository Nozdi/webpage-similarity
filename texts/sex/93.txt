Exploring sensual touch with your partner can be a wonderful way to deepen sexual intimacy, and discover new aspects of your own (and your partner's) sexuality. Sensual touch can be thought of as different from other kinds of touch as it isn't about orgasm, it's about exploration. Think of it less as another technique to get to some end point, and more as a way of communicating without talking. Some people consider this kind of exploration to be "energy work" or "spiritual sex", but it isn't necessary to name it in that way order to do it.
