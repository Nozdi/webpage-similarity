The holiday season is one of the few times each year when we are encouraged to ask for things we want. But there are limits on what we're "supposed" to ask for. New clothes? Yes. A cordless drill? Sure. A little extra time in the oral sex department? Ummm...probably not.

One of the obvious problems is that we're rarely encouraged to talk openly with our partners about our sexual desires. Sex, we're told, comes naturally. Which means we should just know what our partner wants and needs at any given moment. But anyone who has had sex, will know this isn't true.

Today's tip asks you to add to your holiday wish list. You can still lust after the complete series box set of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, or a new I Pod, but I want you to keep digging, past the consumer desires, and into the larger private repository of your sexual interests. What would you love to try with your partner sometime over the holidays? A new position? A sex toy? Fantasy role playing? Simply more time to have the sex you are already having?

Come up with a list of three things* you'd love to do. Here are some guidelines: The first activity should be something you'd like to do to your partner. The second should be something you want your partner to do to you The last activity is something new for both of you, or at least something you haven't done together.

You can tell your partner you're doing this, and ask them to do the same. Or take control of the sled this holiday season, and see where it takes you. Remember to establish good ground rules about sharing sexual wishes, including no judgment and no guilt for saying no or making changes to the wishes.

*If you celebrate Hannukah, or want to pay homage to the festival of lights, you can come up with eight activities and spread them out over eight days.
