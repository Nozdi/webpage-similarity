This disconcerting article by Kara Jesella isn't only about teens, but they are a major segment of the population of women for whom birth control pills are becoming financially out of reach.

Published on Alternet Jesella's article details the growing problem of health clinics (like Planned Parenthood) that can't afford to provide affordable and accessible services as demand increases and budgets decrease.

While the Bush administration continues to pour money into ineffective abstinence-only programs, women without the financial means to pay for oral contraceptives are choosing less effective methods of contraception that often carry greater health risks. At one clinic a pack of Pills cost up to $20, but Depo-Provera (which is associated with loss of bone density in young women) is free.
