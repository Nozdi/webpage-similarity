It's probably the sex position most people have heard of, but if you believe most popular surveys the missionary position is far from the most commonly used position, and with good reason. In the basic position one person is on top of the other, using their arms to support their weight while they provide most of the movement. It requires a lot of effort on one person's part and less on the other, and only gives one partner control. In this way it may not work for many bodies, and even the angle of penetration may not be ideal for the person on the bottom.
