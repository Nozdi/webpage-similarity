Don't force yourself to talk to your kids about sex. The well meaning parent who is so uncomfortable and unable to talk with their kids honestly about sex might very well inadvertently communicate a lot of negative messages about sexuality. Take some time to imagine the process. Imagine it at different ages and stages (both yours and your children). What would it be like to teach your 3 year old the different names for body parts? What would it be like to explain where babies come from, or what sex is? What would it be like to answer questions about STDs, or safer sex? If you imagine these scenarios and shudder, don't put yourself down for it. Getting a sense of your own comfort is crucial. If you think you're too uncomfortable then you may want to read on, and consider talking about it with adults (friends, your partner, even your parents) to get ideas of how other people deal with it.
