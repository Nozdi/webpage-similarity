All children have questions about sex. We can convey to our children in a thousand non-verbal ways that it's okay or not okay to talk about sex. When we don't give our children permission to ask questions or create appropriate time and space for them to ask their questions, the questions come anyway, and they can come at embarrassing or inconvenient times. One of the best ways to do this is to pay attention to the ways your children react when sexuality comes up (it might be something they see on TV, or walking by a couple who are kissing passionately in public) and then let them know they can ask questions. There are several excellent books for children about sex and sexuality, and having these books in the house is another great way of letting your kids know that you're open to talking about it.
