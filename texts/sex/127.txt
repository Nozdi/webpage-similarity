A dental dam is a thin sheet (usually made of latex) that was originally designed for use by dentists during more involved procedures. Over the years, they have been recommended as a barrier to prevent fluid transmission during oral genital contact, oral/vaginal contact ( cunnlingus ) and oral/anal contact ( analingus ). Now there are several companies that package dental dams specifically for sex play, making them larger and (in some cases) scented or flavored. There are also nonlatex dental dams available for those with latex allergies.
