It's hard to believe a year has passed since we last came together to celebrate National Masturbation Month. Of course one of the nice things about this month is that it isn't something we have to do together. Masturbation is primarily a solo activity, even though you might choose to invite someone in, or along, for the ride. And that's what I love about this month.

When people find out that I write and teach about sex for a living they expect me to be thinking and talking about people having sex with other people. After all, that's what real sex is, right? Wrong.

There are limits to sexual exploration on your own, but of the few gross generalizations I make when talking about sex one of them is that we should all at least start by focusing on ourselves. Whether you have a partner or not, whether you want one or not, if you want to head out on any sexual journey it helps to know where you're starting from. It's not necessary, but it helps.

For most of the year I cater to expectations (to a point). Most of what I write about here does have to do with people having sex with each other. But I maintain that some of the best sex any of us have is when we are alone. And I'm happy to have at least one month to indulge in that. Stay tuned all May for more.
