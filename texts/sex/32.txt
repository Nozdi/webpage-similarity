It's hard to say which is more descriptive, the clinical sounding "rear entry" or the animalistic "doggy style," but either way this position is a popular one for people who like deep penetration. In the basic position the partner being penetrated is on their hands and knees, with the penetrating partner behind them. This position is comfortable for both vaginal or anal intercourse.
