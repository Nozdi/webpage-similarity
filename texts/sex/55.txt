A "bot" is a kind of automated software that is pre-programmed to respond to certain inputs with specific outputs. "Bots" (as in ro-bots) are used to mimic human interaction in virtual spaces like web forums and online help centers. When you enter a chat room and text appears from a moderator welcoming you, that is often a bot.

Depending on their sophistication, bots can be programmed to understand and respond in many languages and deal with different kinds of grammatical structure. They can have programmed flexibility to try and make their responses to questions/commands as relevant as possible.

There are many examples of bots being used for human computer sexual interactions. In some, like the web-based "virtual girlfriend" and "virtual boyfriend" software's, the bot is represented by an avatar that can look real but is clearly a virtual image. In others, like the Virtual Fem program, the bot is integrated into live action footage, so the user sees a real woman who they can "have" sex with through voice and text commands.
