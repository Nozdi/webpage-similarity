The only way to get comfortable talking about sex is to talk about sex. The more you talk about sex, the better you'll be at it. And the great thing is that your experience is transferable. If you get comfortable talking about sex with a friend, or even your partner, often that comfort level and self-confidence can help you when talking to your kids. If you're comfortable, your kids will probably be too. By being more comfortable you are modeling a behavior for them. So practice with your partner, with your friends, or with yourself, but increase the time you spend talking about sex, and you'll notice a difference.
