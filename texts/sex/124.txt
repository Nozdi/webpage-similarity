Analingus refers to oral anal contact (licking or sucking around the anus). Also called rimming, analingus is a sexual activity engaged in by people of all genders and sexual orientations. If done without protection analingus can lead to the transmission of STDs, (including hepatitis, herpes and others) and parasites. However if you use a barrier properly whenever you perform analingus it can be a safe and highly pleasurable activity.
