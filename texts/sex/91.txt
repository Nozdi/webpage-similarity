Creating a better sex life requires not only sexual action but sexual reflection. Use the ideas and questions below to guide you in reflecting on lesson seven of the online course 9 Weeks to Better Sex.

This exercise asks you to reflect privately on your experience of your own sex drive and how you experience your partner's sex drive. As you think about the questions below, don't worry about whether or not you're going to share this with your partner. If you can each complete the exercise and then share your answers that would be great, but it's not necessary for the exercise to be valuable.

There are no right or wrong answers to these questions. They are meant to start you thinking only, not to evaluate your thoughts or feelings.

One of the problems I have with the term "sex drive" is that it evokes something hard wired, maybe genetic, certainly something that can't be adapted or changed. There may be some truth to this (although there's no actual proof), but even so, it's both reasonable and possible to expect that partners will compromise and negotiate when their sex drives differ.

When one partner says to the other "that's just the way I am," it sounds like they are unwilling to compromise or even talk about it. If you're working on having better sex, shutting your partner down is not going to get you there. But it's easy to get defensive when talking about sex drive differences. One way to deal with this is to be ready to talk honestly about your feelings and why you get defensive when you do.
