The Fleshlight was conceived, designed, and is still made, by a family-owned business. It was the first high end sex toy for men and it's notable that in an industry based on ripping off successful designs, no one has managed to duplicate The Fleshlight. The true innovation of the Fleshlight is the material. It's difficult to describe in words but it is both soft and substantial, and has a rich enveloping feeling when it surrounds any part of your body. When taken care of properly it's also durable and can last for years.
