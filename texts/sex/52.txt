Basic Missionary Position

 Considered the most common sexual position (although many surveys would indicate that it isn't) and by some the only appropriate position for sex, the missionary position describes a couple lying face to face, with one on top of the other and the partner who is being penetrated is on bottom. It is most associated with heterosexual intercourse, but despite the idea that this is the "traditional" sexual position, it is actually not very good for allowing a lot of movement, and the angle may not be ideal for penetration.

Variations

 Using pillows underneath the partner on the bottom to change up the angle of penetration, and also lift their body off the bed or floor.

Most variations involved the partner on the bottom bending their knees to their chest, or hooking them around the shoulders of the partner on top.
