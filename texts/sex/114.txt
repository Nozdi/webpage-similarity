It might seem strange, but the definition of a sexual problem depends on who you're talking to. This is important to understand because when you read about a study that says that 43% of women have sexual problems, it may not mean what you think it does.

The broadest definition of a sexual problem is something that gets in the way of you enjoying sex. If we only had sex by ourselves defining sexual problems would be easier. But add a partner and all of the sudden figuring out who decides when something is a problem and what it is, becomes much more complicated.

If you ask a sex therapist about what constitutes a sexual problem they would agree with the above definition but would emphasize that whatever is happening isn't just puzzling to you but is causing you distress. They would likely also include problems in relationships as sex problems. So, for example, you may be perfectly happy having sex once a year, but if you're partner wants it once a week, then as a couple, you've got a sex problem.

And then there is the world of sex research. In sex research a sexual problem isn't necessarily something that an individual cares about at all. Researchers often choose fixed definitions to measure who has sexual problems. So, for example, if you never have an orgasm, even if you don't mind, you'd be classified as having a sexual problem. If you rarely want to have sex, even if you're perfectly happy, researchers would count you as having a sexual problem.

So as far as sex researchers are concerned, whether you think you have a problem or not, if you fit certain criteria, you've got a sexual problem.
