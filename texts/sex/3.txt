When most people talk about sex, and when researchers say they are studying sex, usually they mean intercourse . And not just any intercourse, but specifically penile-vaginal intercourse. Even without a lot of sex education, most people move into adulthood with the understanding that intercourse is, or should be, the core of healthy sexuality.

There are no right or wrong answers here (including the answer that sex IS intercourse). Whatâ€™s most important is asking yourself the questions and giving yourself time and permission to think about the answers.If youâ€™re already having intercourse youâ€™ve already figured out how to find a sexual partner. The next step to moving outside of the socially sanctioned sexual box is to start talking to your partner about what you think about sex.You may already have the thinking and talking part dealt with.
