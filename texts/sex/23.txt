The Japanese Rabbit Habit vibrator is an innovation on the classic Pearl Rabit vibrator, and definitely worth trying for anyone who has already figured out that they like vibration. Avoid inexpensive copies and stick with the Vibratex original.

The Rabbit Habit vibrator is one of those instantly recognizable sex toys, made famous most recently by Sex in the City. Commonly referred to as a dual action vibrator the Rabbit Habit provides simultaneous clitoral stimulation and a rotating shaft that is safe for vaginal insertion. Some users report that the beads also provide g spot stimulation.

It doesn't make the best first time sex toy because it isn't very versatile. It does one (actually two) things, and it does them very well. So if you know you like clitoral stimulation and penetration, this may be well worth the investment.

Be aware of the hundreds of cheap imitators out there. One way to make sure you are getting a product of quality is to find out who the manufacturer is. Vibratex is one of the oldest importers and designers of vibrators made in Japan, and they stand by their products.
