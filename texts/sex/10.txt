National Masturbation Month turns 19 this year. Its popularity has waxed and waned, but I like to think of it as the holiday that won't quit. At least not until someone finally creates and markets a line of greeting cards.

A few years into the annual celebration, back when I was a member of a sex store worker co-operative, I wrote an article about my own relationship to masturbation for our local alternative weekly newspaper. Today I went back to read it. Aside from cringing at how I wrote 11 years ago I found myself feeling a bit nostalgic. And it got me thinking.

Most of the time when we talk about sex we're talking about sex with other people. And when we're asked to recall our sexual histories how often are the askers really asking about our solo sex histories?

When do we have time to reflect on what is, for all of us, the longest sexual relationship we'll ever have; the one with ourselves?

No better time than the present. In fact looking back seems like a fitting way to look forward to this month full of solo sex and self love. To get your memories flowing I thought I'd offer this short masturbation history questionnaire for you to fill out. As with masturbation, this is meant to be something just for you. Don't put your name on the paper and only share with someone who has asked (and who you trust).

1. What is your earliest memory of masturbation?

 a) How old were you?

 b) Where were you? 

 c) Did anyone notice and if so did they make you feel bad about it?

2. Thinking back 5, 10, 15, or 20 years, how has your masturbation changed:

 a) Did you do it differently?

 b) More or less often?

 c) In different locations?

 d) Were your fantasies different from the ones you have today?

3. What was your most memorable masturbation experience?

4. Do you masturbate more or less when you are in a relationship? Has that changed over time?

5. What's the longest time you've gone without masturbating?
