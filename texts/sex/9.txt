Flibanserin is a non-hormonal drug that affects both serotonin and dopamine in the brain. It is currently being investigated as a treatment for low sexual desire in women, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

Flibanserin was first investigated as an anti-depressant, but it was found to be ineffective in treatment of depression. When researchers noticed the drug had a secondary effect of increasing sexual interest, they began exploring whether or not it could be used to address complaints of low sexual desire in women.

Flibanserin is an oral medication designed to be taken once a day. Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that is developing Flibanserin, is still engaged in research trials; it is too early to make any substantive claims on the overall effectiveness or safety of the drug. But in clinical trials, it has demonstrated a modest increase (statistically speaking) in the number of self-defined satisfying sexual events when compared with women taking a placebo. The research also reports a decrease in distress related to sexual desire.

Side effects in the clinical trials include nausea, daytime sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, dry mouth, and insomnia.

Flibanserin is one of a handful of medications being aggressively marketed as the next breakthrough in sex drugs -- a kind of "female Viagra." Currently there is no information about when the drug maker will be ready to submit to the FDA for Flibanserin's approval, or how much the drug would cost if it became available.
