The sun may be shining and the drop-tops, well, dropping their tops, but the New England Motor Press Association recently took the opportunity to recognize a wide range of automakers with its Winter Vehicle awards, as well as several other Best-In-Class trophies.

The actual judging took place in February, when NEMPA members gathered at the group's unofficial headquarters south of Boston to evaluate and compare a parking lot full of nominated vehicles. However, the awards ceremony took place in May, coinciding with a NEMPA/MIT-sponsored conference detailing a host of issues related to the future of autonomous vehicles.

As it turns out, we can expect to see those driverless rides branching beyond the R&D arena within ten years. But, for now, we'll continue to be tasked with driving ourselves. To learn which models NEMPA recommends for the job, check out the complete list of winners.
