Official details about the contract between the UAW and General Motors are out, and the biggest item: GM has agreed to create or keep 6,400 jobs as it invests $2.5 billion in product and plant investments.

In exchange, the UAW has negotiated new buyout offers between $10,000 and $65,000, in order to entice older workers to retire, so that they can be replaced with younger, less expensive workers.

Among the investments will be the production of two new mid-size vehicles, to be built at GM's plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, which will re-open. Other plants will receive investments that were originally slated for Mexico, according to the UAW. As part of the deal, GM will eventually build a new compact car and compact pickup truck in the U.S.

The full details are quite a lot to read through, but at a glance, it's clear the UAW got a lot of what it wanted without crippling GM's cost flexibility. It also appears the UAW gave GM a chance to save money in the long run, even if up front, the company will need to spend a lot of money.

Time will tell how fair the deal ultimately is, but for now, it looks like the UAW did well for itself without kneecapping management.
