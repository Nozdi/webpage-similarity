A note for my regular blog readers -- I have some good news and some bad news.

You might have seen About.com in the news over the past few months. About a year and a half ago, the New York Times Corporation sold us to IAC, and since then our new owners have been making massive changes behind the scenes. And thank goodness -- if ever a web site needed the upgrades, it was ours.

The good news is that next month, About.com will begin rolling out a much-needed site redesign. (We're finally going to shed-our 1990s-era page layout!) One of the big changes will be to the home page. Essentially, the "blog" format is going away; our home page will now feature articles. (You can see a preview at our Neurology and Home Security sites.)

This really is good news -- it brings us into line with what other web sites are doing. The bad news is that we're going to lose blog comments. No big deal for some About.com sites, but it's a blow for us, as I've not only enjoyed the two-way communication, but I always gain a lot of perspective from your thoughts and sentiments.

Update: I just got word that comments may be shut down as early as today to prepare for the home page change.

I want to keep the conversation going, so with your help, I'd like to move it to my Autonerd page on Facebook. Every time I post a new article, I'll post a link to a Facebook discussion. (Let's try it now: Discuss this post.) The Autonerd page is also where I post links to articles and videos I do for other publications, so it's a great way to keep up with All Things Aaron.

I hope you'll join me over there and continue the conversation, and I hope you like the look of the redesign -- we should see it here at the Cars site in a week or so. As always, thanks for reading, commenting, and continuing to support About.com Cars! -- Aaron Gold
