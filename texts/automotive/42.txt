The Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV was one of the vehicles that helped GM emerge from bankruptcy after it was redesigned. Now the Canadian Auto Workers are worried that production of the vehicle will move from plants in the Toronto area to Tennessee, as part of GM's new deal with the UAW here in the U.S.

The worry is that with GM's plant in Spring Hill springing back into action, some production of the Equinox and its twin, the GMC Terrain, could shift there, which could cost the CAW some jobs.

The head of the CAW, Ken Lewenza, is seeking assurances from GM that his plants will remain the primary source for production of the Equinox and Terrain, which could keep jobs north of the border. In that scenario, Spring Hill could produce extra units of the vehicles, which are in high demand.
