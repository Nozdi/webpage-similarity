With over a third of the country buried in snow and many roads and retail businesses shut down, I want to know: How do you deal with the snow?

If you own a dealership, storage lot, or other outdoor automotive facility, how are you handling it?

During my long-ago dealership days, we moved as many cars indoors as possible, plowed the lot, and the cleaned the remaining cars off when the snow stopped. We also salted and shoveled any pedestrian walkways. Snow storms meant the possibility of going home early, but they also meant a lot of hard work.

What do you do? Leave a note in the comments.
