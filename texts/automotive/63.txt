General Motors and the UAW have reached their first labor agreement since the company's emergence from bankruptcy protection.

The proposed contract would add factory jobs and include profit-sharing bonuses, and it would cover about 48,500 workers. The four-year contract still needs to be ratified by rank-and-file workers.

Most details of the deal won't be released until Tuesday when the UAW meets in Detroit, but it appears that 570 laid-off workers will be recalled, an idled plant in Tennessee will resume production, and give one-time $5,000 bonuses to each current worker.

The union choose to negotiate with GM first, with Chrysler and Ford next in line, sources were quoted as saying in the Chicago Tribune.

This bodes well for both the UAW and automakers, as any kind of labor strife could derail the industry's recovery efforts. We'll see whether the deal is fair or favors one side or the other as details trickle out, but for now, the presence of a proposed deal is a good sign.
