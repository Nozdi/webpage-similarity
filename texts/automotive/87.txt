Take me straight to the review!

When the last-generation Legacy came out, I wasn't a huge fan -- not because there was anything wrong with the car, but because I thought it had lost a lot of its Subaru-y character. Subaru still hasn't forgiven me for the opening paragraph of my 2010 Legacy review, and to be fair, they have a point -- I was judging the car against its predecessor, not against its competition.

So when the all-new 2015 Legacy came out, I vowed to look at it as I would a Camry, or an Altima, or an Accord, or any other mid-size sedan. And you know what? From that perspective, the Legacy does look a lot different. Get the full story in my 2015 Subaru Legacy test drive. -- Aaron Gold

A note on photos: As always, I've packed the review with links to larger photos, but there are problems with the Legacy photo gallery at present -- our system is cropping the images square. Click on the image and you'll see the whole thing. Hopefully our gurus can get this fixed quickly.
