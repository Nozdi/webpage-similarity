If you live where it snows, chances are you've seen more than your share of rusted-out cars. Rust isn't just ugly -- it also reduces your car's structural strength and can weaken its ability to protect you in an accident. Follow this three-season schedule to help keep your car rust-free.

Time to go into full rust-fighting mode!

When the snow is gone for good, check your car for signs of rust. Remember, once rust starts, it only gets worse, so consider having a competent body shop repair any rust spots. Enjoy the summer, and get ready to do battle again next year!
