Once the 2012 Toyota Camry hits showrooms this fall, the company will no longer be importing units from Japan, meaning one of the best-selling Japanese cars will be completely American-made.

Right now, only a small percentage of Camrys are imported to the U.S. from Japan, so the move makes sense, both as a cost-cutting measure and a way to offset exchange rates. The car will continue to be built in Kentucky and Indiana.

It's unclear what this means for dealers and suppliers, although with the Camry continuing to be a best-seller, it's possible that the UAW could increase its focus on organizing labor at Toyota's American plants. It is possible that sticker prices might be a tad lower.

Once again, the fact that the best-selling Japanese car is built in America shows how truly global the auto industry is.
