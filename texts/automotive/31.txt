The automotive industry is recovering from the Great Recession, and there are a few things to keep an eye on as the industry gets better in fits and starts.

In this socially networked world, consumers are increasingly unwilling to stop texting and Facebooking while they're on the go. High tech was a theme of the 2011 North American International Auto Show, and it's expected to continue to drive buyer decisions in the near term.

With the greater economy recovering, it's expected that customers will start shopping for new cars and trucks again. This is good news for almost everyone involved in the industry.

The industry continues to bet big on small cars--most new models introduced in Detroit at the 2011 NAIAS were mid-size models or smaller. Big cars and large SUVs still have a place--as witnessed by Chrysler's unveiling of the redesigned 300 full-size sedan--but tightening CAFE regulations and rising fuel prices will keep the short-term focus on small cars.

For better or for worse, automakers will continue to use Twitter and Facebook to advertise. So will their dealers. While engaging your customers is obviously a good thing, those who do it poorly might drive away business. Those who ignore social media--and those who choose not to monitor what is being said about their business online--do so at their own peril.

Those who are connected in anyway to the Detroit automakers stand to benefit as they continue to surge (in Ford's case) and rebound from bankruptcy (in the case of GM and Chrysler). As consumers continue to return to Big Three showrooms, those companies will receive a much-needed boost. And so will the industry as a whole.
