Now that the UAW has finished negotiating with GM, Chrysler is next in the contract-negotiation cross-hairs, and the company would like to avoid having to pay raises or cost-of-living increases as it aims to keep fixed costs where they are until 2019.

Chrysler would likely seek assurances from the UAW that union will not push for those kind of pay increases during the next round of talks.

This is an indication that Chrysler would like to seek a new business model which keeps labor costs in line as it continues to recover from bankruptcy--a sign that the Chrysler's new management either believes costs were too high in the past or that it needs flexibility in order to compete with rivals that have lower labor costs.

This doesn't mean that talks between and the union will be acrimonious, the UAW might have other goals in mind, such as the creation of additional jobs or improved health care. This simply means Chrysler has taken a stand on wages, and that they've made their position clear ahead of the negotiations.
