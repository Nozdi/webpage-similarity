The federal government set aside $25 billion for its Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan program in September 2008. Over 100 applicants have filed for $42.7 billion in money, but so far the Department of Energy has loaned out only $8.5 billion.

This has upset automakers, suppliers, members of Congress, and start-up companies that have been hoping to use that money to fund projects. In some cases, the loans have been approved, but have taken months to close.

In the case of the larger companies, the delay in funding can derail major projects. Smaller companies and start-ups may go under before they see the much-needed money.

It's unclear why the loans are being held up, but what is clear is that without the loans, it will be more difficult for certain projects to come to fruition.
