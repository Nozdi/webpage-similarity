Take me straight to the review!

Today I'm once again going to turn the helm over to Frank Aukofer, who tested a car I've not yet driven: The 2014 MINI Cooper. Now, when I saw the new MINI, I thought it was going to be as close to the outgoing 2nd-generation MINI as that car was to the first-gen MINI. But Frank says no -- he says there's a definite change in the all-new MINI Cooper's demeanor. Find out why in his 2014 MINI Cooper DriveWays review. -- Aaron Gold
