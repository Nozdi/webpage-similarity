Union support for the Occupy Wall St. movement has been growing, but the bet here is that despite the bailouts of the GM and Chrysler, there won't be much involvement from either the UAW or management, especially as UAW contract talks with the Big Three are fresh in everyone's mind.

That doesn't mean the UAW won't show support to union brethren, but it just appears that this protest and any backlash have little to do with auto industry and more to do with banking, finance, and policy-making regarding those two industries. So I just can't imagine Occupy Wall St. doing much to help or hurt bottom lines.
