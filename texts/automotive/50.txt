General Motors (NYSE:GM) has named Mary Barra, 49, as the company's new senior vice president of global product development.

Before taking over the role as the company's top product person, Barra had been the vice president of global human resources. In her new role, she'll be in charge of deciding what products the company builds, as well as where those products will be built. She will be overseeing all 11 of GM's global brands.

Due at least in part to the auto industry's long product lead times, it might take a while to see how Barra's decisions impact the company.

It's a safe bet that GM is hoping to continue to build momentum in this post-bankruptcy period. As the economy grows and the company continues to recover, GM is probably hoping it can continue on the roll that saw Chevrolet produce 4.26 million vehicles last year.
