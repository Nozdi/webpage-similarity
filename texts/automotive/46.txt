According to at least one outlet, things might be looking up for the recession-racked auto industry in 2011.

While automakers are eagerly expecting increased sales--Edmunds.com is predicting total sales of 11.5 million units in 2010 and 12.9 units in 2011--those numbers are still a far cry short of the 17 million units sold in 2006. And despite the growing buzz surrounding alternative-fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles and hybrids, those types of vehicles make up a small slice of the sales pie. Hybrids still make up less than five percent of total sales.

Despite the still-sputtering economy, automakers are counting on several factors to help stimulate the market. One of those is the fact that many American consumers are driving older cars. Some of these folks will have to get back into the new car market as their cars age.

Add to that the Fiat's re-entry into the American market, and the buzz surrounding the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric vehicle along with Nissan's Leaf electric vehicle, combined with the rise of small cars such as the Chevrolet Cruze and the upcoming redesigned Ford Focus, and there are reasons for optimism.

Other reasons to be optimistic include Chrysler's revival and strong sales gains by Subaru, Volkswagen, and Hyundai.

That's the good news. That bad news is that unemployment is still high, and the economy's growth is still uncertain at best.

That hasn't stopped automakers and industry observers from exuding optimism. And with plenty of new offerings on the way--and the 2011 North American International Auto Show just a few weeks away--the optimists just might be right.
