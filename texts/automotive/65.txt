While 750 new jobs won't be enough to help lower Michigan's unemployment rate, that doesn't mean it isn't good news for General Motors (NYSE:GM).

The company is adding a third shift to its Flint Assembly Plant in Flint, Michigan, which builds the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pick-up trucks.

The shift will be added in the third quarter with employees arriving to begin production ramp-up in the second.

Currently, the plant employs 2,100 workers in two shifts.
