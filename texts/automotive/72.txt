TrueCar, a Web site that provides pricing data for automotive transactions, has raised $200 million in order to purchase other companies that provide industry data.

TrueCar has already purchased Automotive Lease Guide, which is the primary provider of residual lease values to automakers. TrueCar has also already purchased Carperks, a car-buying service for employees of large companies. Plans to purchase more companies are in the works.

What this means is that TrueCar continues to grow, it will join Kelley Blue Book and others as a destination place for dealers looking for information on automotive pricing and other data. Those dealers who are Internet-savvy should keep an eye on TrueCar as another potential data tool in the inventory.
