Ford (NYSE:F) is looking to spend $400 million to build a new model at its Kansas City, Mo., plant. Currently, that plant builds the Ford Escape small SUV and the F-150 pickup truck on a separate line.

With production of the Escape moving to Louisville, Ky., Ford is going to build a new body shop, add new tooling, and install other upgrades using the money. About 3,750 jobs will be retained, thanks to the investment.Ford is mum on what that new model will be, but the Kansas City plant is the fourth one to undergo retooling for the pending production of new models.

A state bill, the 2010 Missouri Manufacturing Jobs Act, provides tax incentives to auto manufacturers that create new investments and add or retain jobs in Missouri. Suppliers who create new jobs in Missouri also can earn the incentives. By retaining the jobs, Ford is eligible for the incentives.

As noted above, Ford won't say what the new model is. We'll just have to wait for a future auto show to find out.
