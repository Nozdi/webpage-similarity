Volkswagen seems to think so.

I'm just back from my first drive of the all-new 2015 Volkswagen Golf, and it's interesting to see how much content VW has put into these cars. Even the basic "S" model (shown here) is surprisingly plush, with a padded dash, V-Tex upholstery (that fake leather stuff with which I fell in love in our long-term Passat TDI), a display stereo, turbo engine (the same 1.8T engine I drove [and loved] in the '14 Passat), alloy wheels, and -- for the first time, as far as I know -- the option of a diesel in the base model.

Now, I'm sure a lot of this has to do with lessons learned from the "decontented" 2011 Jetta (remember my review of the base-model Jetta S? Cripes, what a disappointment that car was!). But after listening to VW's marketing plans for the Golf, it appears there's more to it -- they say cars like the Mazda3 and Subaru Impreza have stirred interest in premium hatchbacks, and indeed most manufacturers do price and position their hatchbacks higher than sedans.

So what do you think -- is the hatchback making a comeback, or is this wishful thinking on Volkswagen's part? Vote in our poll and sound off in the Comments section. Look for my review coming soon -- I'm jetting off to drive the new 2015 Subaru Legacy this weekend, then I'll be back at the keyboard. -- Aaron Gold
