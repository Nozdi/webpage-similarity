The EPA has listed the ten most fuel-efficient 2014 cars on sale in America -- but are they cars you would actually want to drive? This list goes beyond the numbers and tells you which ones are worth buying and which ones are best left at the showroom. Here they are, ranked lowest-to-highest by EPA combined fuel economy. (NOTE: This list excludes electric cars and plug-in hybrids, since real-world MPG varies so much.)
