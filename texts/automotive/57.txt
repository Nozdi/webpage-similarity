Ailing automaker Mitsubishi is revamping its lineup, and the Galant sedan and Eclipse sports coupe will be left out in the cold as the automaker focuses on electrification. The Endeavor SUV will also be dropped.

These models are being dropped due to slow sales, and Mitsubishi will look to fill their spots with hybrid and electric models.

The Eclipse was once a solid contender among sports coupes, but it hasn't drawn the public's attention in recent years, mostly because it has been getting long in the tooth. The Galant has simply been unable to match up to better offerings in the mid-size sedan class

What this means for the brand is that after focusing on younger buyers--and watching those efforts backfire when the economy tanked, causing loan defaults to soar--the company is now trying to jump ahead of the alternative fuels curve. Even if electric vehicles are in their infancy in the U.S., Mitsubishi is playing smart by looking ahead, especially in light of rising fuel prices. Electric cars may or may not succeed on our shores, but if they do, Mitsubishi will look smart for having foreseen the future. And if they don't, Mitsubishi will have conventional vehicles for sale, and the brand's marketers can still trumpet the early foray in to electric tech as a willingness to take gambles on innovation.

As for workers at the company's Normal, Ill., plant, their jobs should be spared even with the loss of the Eclipse, Endeavor, and Galant. At least one model--likely the Outlander Sport crossover SUV--will be built there in the future.
