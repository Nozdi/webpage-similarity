Take me straight to the review!

I'm back from my travels and have lots of keyboarding ahead, so in the meantime, I have another DriveWays review from Frank Aukofer, this time on Kia's new hot-hatch contender, the 201 hp Kia Forte5 SX.

Get the full story in Frank's 2014 Kia Forte5 SX review. -- Aaron Gold
