As an automotive journalist, I spend a lot of time reviewing cars. What I don't do a lot of is forecasting the future. Well, in this post, I am going to join the hordes of writers who have taken a shot at getting guesses about the future right. In about six months, check back to see whether you should cheer me or throw eggs at my condo (I live in a high-rise, so good luck throwing that high).

We are now more than a year out from General Motors and Chrysler's bankruptcy. We are still in the grips of a nasty recession, but the economy has shown signs of growth, despite the stubbornly high unemployment rate. Thanks to that growth, and the success of programs such as Cash for Clunkers, sales have grown some.

What dealers and industry employees are worried about is how much sales will grow. After reaching annual sales of more than 16 million units during the boom years, the industry slipped a lot closer to 10 million during last year's dark days. Where do we go from here?

Well, 16 million looks like a moon shot, but I think that for 2010, an improvement of a million or two units from 2009 isn't out of the question. A few positive economic signs plus a slew of long-awaited new model launches will help, especially since Chrysler/Fiat now has begun hinting at what product it has in the pike. With GM in the midst of a product renaissance, and with Ford continuing to show strong performance, the industry should continue to slowly dig its way out of the doldrums, although the pace won't be fast unless the economy improves.

There you have it. A safe prediction, to be sure, but dealers and automaker employees should rest slightly easier at night. 2009 is behind us, and even if the economy slips again, it's unlikely sales will back to that level.

And if I am wrong, well, eggs are on sale at your local supermarket.
