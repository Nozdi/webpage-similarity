As contract negotiations between the UAW and the Detroit Three automakers continue, it appears that GM and the UAW may be close to a framework of a final agreement.

A message on a joint UAW-GM Web site suggests that the two are entering into the final stages of an agreement.

Talks with Chrysler, meanwhile, are continuing.

This could be a good sign overall, for both sides. Contract negotiations are generally tension-filled affairs, and given the state of both the automotive industry and the overall economy, it behooves both management and labor to get a deal that both sides can be happy with. The progress with GM and the continuation of talks with Chrysler can probably both be perceived as good signs.
