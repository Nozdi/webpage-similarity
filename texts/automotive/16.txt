Chrysler will be spending $165 million to add a body shop to its plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan.

The one-million square foot plant will be used to build the next generation of Chrysler's mid-size sedans, starting in 2013.

The new body shop will replace the current one, which will be used for other purposes. There will be no net gain of jobs.

This news shows that Chrysler is serious in competing from a product stand point. The company will need to be competitive in the mid-size segment, and the current Chrysler 200 and Dodge Avenger, while better than their predecessors, still fall a bit short. While no jobs will be gained by this announcement, the new body shop could mean better quality, and it shows a commitment to improved product overall in the segment.
