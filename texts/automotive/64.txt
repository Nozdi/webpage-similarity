This is the time of year when automakers begin launching new models for the next model year, and the 2011 crop is one of the most interesting in years. With Ford launching the 2011 Fiesta compact hatchback, Nissan introducing the 2011 Juke crossover, and Hyundai introducing its Equus flagship luxury sedan, the choices have rarely been more interesting.

That's before you remember that this is an industry in full recovery mode--just last year, two of the Big Three American automakers went through bankruptcy proceedings. With the economy sputtering its way back to health--or back into recession, if you're a naysayer--the future looks uncertain, if not more promising, that it did a year ago at this time.

A renewed focus on "green" cars--both the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric vehicle and the Nissan Leaf electric car launch this year--also adds to the drama.

All this is to say that the next two or three months bear close watching, and it's an exciting time for industry observers. The future may be uncertain, but it's certainly exciting.
