Chevrolet, General Motors' (NYSE:GM) mainstream brand, sold 4.26 million vehicles across the globe last year--averaging one sale per every 7.4 seconds.

This is despite the fact the as part of GM, Chevrolet has been recovering from bankruptcy. Not to mention the fact that the economy has been growing in fits and starts, where it has been growing at all.

December was a particularly strong month for Chevy, as the company sold 416,826 units. That makes it the best December in Chevrolet history and it was the 15th consecutive monthly increase.

What has driven such a dramatic turnaround in such turbulent times? Strong product, for one. Starting with the Malibu in 2006, the entire Chevrolet lineup has been made over, with the last of the old models, the subcompact Aveo, soon to be replaced by the Sonic. Also, strong global demand has helped keep Chevy afloat even when sales tanked in the U.S.

Sure, some U.S. buyers punished Chevrolet (along with all other GM brands, as well as products sold by the Chrysler group) for taking federal government bailout money. But perhaps not as many as the experts thought. With strong products and solid advertising and marketing, Chevrolet is starting to find itself back on solid footing.
