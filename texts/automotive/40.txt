While it may be losing some thunder to the Los Angeles, the North American International Auto Show in Detroit is still the barometer that automotive industry observers use to figure out what kind of products might be hot in the coming months.

In the case of the this year's NAIAS, conventional small cars might be in the spotlight. Hyundai's Veloster and Buick's Verano appear to be leading the way here, and it's no surprise that small cars are hot again. With gas prices edging back up, unemployment staying high, and automakers finding ways to pack more features into smaller, less-expensive cars, it's easy to see why consumers might gravitate towards compacts and subcompacts.

That said, the future isn't all econoboxes. Porsche plans to spring a sports-car surprise on the public in Detroit, and it's expected that Chrysler will show off the new 300 full-size sedan.

As always, Detroit will offer something for everyone. And for fans of small cars, the 2011 North American International Auto Show will definitely be worth checking out.
