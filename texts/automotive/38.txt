Ford will keep the production of its mid-size Ford Fusion sedan in Mexico as it negotiates its next contract with the UAW.

That means that the UAW won't gain about 4,000 jobs its seeking as part of the negotiations, even as Ford and the UAW talk about adding 10,000 jobs overall.

Since the UAW is unlikely to get wage increases or a cost-of-living allowance, getting more jobs will help get UAW workers to ratify the contract.
