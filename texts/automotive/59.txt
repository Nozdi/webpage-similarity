An interesting bit of automotive economic news has emerged over the past few days: Mid-size cars are actually cheaper than their small-car breathren.

Really. No, really, it's true.

For those who haven't noticed, recently launched small cars like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Cruze have high top-end prices that intersect with the base prices of the larger mid-size cars.

What does that mean for the industry? Well, it means that consumers are at a crossroads, and if you're a dealer or work for a manufacturer, it could affect the way cars are sold.

For all the excitement over some of these new small cars, if the price creeps that high, consumers may be tempted to step up to the larger mid-size autos. This could affect selling strategy--is it better for a dealer to focus on the new cars that are drawing customers into the showroom, or can a dealer earn more profit by getting consumers to step up to the larger cars? And will customers be willing to trade some size for a lower content list, since those mid-size cars will be at the lower end of the price spectrum for the class?

It's a tough dilemma that the automakers have created by attempting to sell small cars with desirable equipment. And it's one that only dealers will be able to answer. Perhaps the best choice for dealers is to follow basic business practices by determine what will sell best in the local market, and adjusting from there. Because the manufacturer isn't changing the sticker price anytime soon.
