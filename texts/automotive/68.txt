Struggling Saab has received a $96 million lifeline to stay afloat for a little while longer while it tries to get court protection from its creditors. Saab signed a technology licensing deal, which will help it earn extra cash to stay afloat.

The company has already appealed a Swedish court decision to deny its attempt to try and defend itself from creditors, and two unions representing white-collar Saab employees have filed a court petition to try and have the company placed in bankruptcy. If Saab is placed in bankruptcy, it could help the unions recover lost wages.

Saab's saga isn't over yet, and these new developments show just how vulnerable to company remains.
