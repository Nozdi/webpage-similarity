2009 Subaru Impreza 2.5i hatchback

The Subaru Impreza 2.5i is my favorite choice for new and nervous drivers, because it's the only small, affordable car with standard all-wheel-drive (AWD). AWD gives the 2009 Subaru Impreza a stronger grip on the pavement than front- or rear-wheel-drive cars. For 2009, Subaru has made the Impreza 2.5i's safety package even better -- but does being the safest make it the best?

2010 Subaru Legacy test drive

Subaru's mid-size Legacy has been completely redesigned for 2010, with a focus on becoming more mainstream -- bigger back seat, larger trunk, new styling and refined powertrain choices. The old Legacy was a favorite of mine -- will the old Legacy keep the flame alive? Read on. 2010 Subaru Legacy: Tested and reviewed by Aaron Gold, your Guide to Cars at About.com.

2009 Subaru Impreza WRX test drive

Subaru has made major improvements to the performance-oriented Impreza WRX -- an unusual move, considering that an all-new WRX was launched just last year. Nevertheless, the Impreza WRX storms into 2009 with a more powerful engine, improved styling and dynamics, and without an automatic transmission. Frankly, I thought the 2008 WRX was a pretty good car -- so have the changes made it any better? Read on. Tested by Aaron Gold, your Guide to Cars at About.com.

2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI test drive

Test-driving Subaru's all-wheel-drive Impreza STI is always a bit awkward for me. In the great STI vs. Evo debate, I've always been a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution man. But for 2011, Subaru has implemented a series of changes to the Impreza WRX STI that almost seem like a custom-tailored effort to win me over. Has it worked? Read on. 2011 Subaru...
