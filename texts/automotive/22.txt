The auto show circuit is a great place to learn about the future of the industry when it comes to design, and if recent trends are any indication, that future will focus on curves and rounded edges.

Just take a look at most of the recently introduced or redesigned models on the market. Crossovers, small cars, large sedans--almost all have at least some curvature. This is because rounded edges improve airflow, thus improving fuel economy, but also because the look seems to be going over well with consumers.

Automakers are in business to make a profit, and one way to do that is to appeal to what consumers say they want in focus groups. Also, like in any industry, if one design or product is a hit, then competitors will inevitably follow with similar designs of their own.

Today's design trends are driven by more than just popularity, though. With tougher federal fuel economy standards looming, automakers are under the gun to make cars as fuel efficient as possible. Higher mile per gallon numbers will also appeal to cost-conscious consumers, if the price of fuel continues to stay high. Consumers also are conscious of having a green image these days, so that plays into buying decisions for many new-car buyers.

The Toyota Prius was one of the first cars to follow this trend, since that car's mission revolves around achieving the highest mpg possible. But automakers have long known that swoopy shapes slice the air better than blockier designs. What's changed, then, is shifting consumer tastes, rising fuel prices, and increased pressure on automakers to keep mpg high throughout the fleet.

Many folks wonder why real-world designs often don't match the flights of fancy shown on concept cars. Well, the above example shows how practical concerns often trump designer's whims.

Of course, should the whims of the consumer--or the government--change, expect to see different design trends.
