Despite a steep drop in fourth-quarter profit as the company made moves to pay off debt, Ford Motor Company made a $6.56 billion profit in 2010--its best in more than ten years.

Popular products have helped pave the way for Ford, along with a perception that the automaker was untainted by federal government bailout money.

The company is in the midst of an aggressive product launch cycle at the moment, with the 2011 Ford Fiesta landing last spring, followed by the refreshed 2011 Ford Edge, updated 2011 F-150, and redesigned 2011 Ford Explorer. Up next, the 2012 Ford Focus, which I drove last week (a review will be forthcoming next week when the embargo breaks).

Ford will be challenged to keep the momentum going, but with the C-Max people mover on the way to our shores and with a redesigned Escape SUV on the horizon, the parade of product isn't over yet.

Doubtless, Ford hopes the same about the parade of profit.
