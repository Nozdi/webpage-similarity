As previously mentioned, the UAW and GM have tentatively agreed on a new contract. Now it's up to members of the UAW to ratify it.

The details will be unveiled formally on Tuesday, but early indications are that the new contract will be ratified by the rank-and-file. Analysts seem to think that they'll love the deal, since some jobs will be added, and some wages will be raised.

The UAW will brag that it protected its workers while GM will likely suggest its concessions are a sign of recovery. Whatever the case, if the deal is ratified, it marks significant progress in the labor talks between the UAW and the Detroit Three. One down, two to go.
