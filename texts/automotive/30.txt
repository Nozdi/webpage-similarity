The UAW and Chrysler agreed to a new contract on Tuesday, though it's unclear if some of the promised benefits to the UAW were part of the deal or were items that were already on the table and under the discussion.

The tentative deal, which still must be ratified by workers, is a four-year contract that promises 2,100 new jobs, a $4.5 billion investment by Chrysler in the company's plants, a $3,500 signing bonus, and a $1,000 annual bonus. Entry-level wages will be raised to $19.28 per hour by 2015, and Chrysler employees could take part in profit-sharing.

The problem, according to Automotive News, is that much of the $4.5 billion isn't "new" investment--it's already earmarked for items that have already been discussed.

Whatever the case, a new deal is now in place, and if it's ratified, it will help both the UAW and Chrysler move forward.
