Ford Motor Company is betting that vehicle sales--both of its products along with the vehicles produced by other automakers--will fall short of the 13 million units that experts had predicted for 2011.

The company had predicted that the U.S. market would see between 13 and 13.5 million sales, but now Ford is looking at analysts' models that predict around 12.7 million sales.

This isn't all doom and gloom--falling a relative tick short of 13 million doesn't mean the market is doomed. It simply means that the road ahead will be long and slow, and that until the housing sector and consumer confidence picks up, and until unemployment drops, sales expectations will need to be lower.
