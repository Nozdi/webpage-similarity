Perhaps concerned that younger buyers don't like to haggle, Chrysler has asked its dealers not to haggle with buyers on the pricing of its Fiat 500 hatchback.

The company is expecting that younger buyers will be drawn to the 500, and while Chrysler generally can't forbid its dealers from haggling, the company would prefer that they don't, in order to make the experience better for younger customers.

As it is, the company kept the number of U.S. Fiat dealers low--to around 130--in order to minimize competition among them.

It remains to be seen if the strategy works, but it's not a new approach--General Motors once used no-haggle pricing with the now-defunct Saturn brand.
