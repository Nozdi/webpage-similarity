 Mitosis

 Introduction to mitosis and the process of cell division.

 

 Interphase

 Interphase is the "holding" stage or the stage between two successive cell divisions.

 

 Prophase

 Prophase is a beautiful menagerie of changes that occur in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of a dividing cell.

 

 Metaphase

 In metaphase, chromosomes align at the metaphase plate of the dividing cell.

 

 Anaphase

 In anaphase, the paired chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends of the dividing cell.

 

 Telophase

 In telophase, the nucleus of one cell is divided equally into two nuclei.
