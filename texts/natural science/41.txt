In 1991 the internal republics comprising the country of Yugoslavia divided up and became five seperate countries: Bosnia and Herzegovina Slovenia , and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)

Serbia and Montenegro claims to be the successor country to the former Yugoslavia so uses the name "Yugoslavia" but it is not recognized as an independent country by many other countries, including the United States.
