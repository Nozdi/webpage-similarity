During the process of mitosis, the genetic material of a cell is split evenly between two daughter cells. UCLA researchers have discovered that cancer cells however, can divide into three or more daughter cells. The researchers developed a platform that creates an environment similar to one that a cell experiences naturally. When confined in this environment, the cancer cells exhibited abnormal cell division. Some cells divided into as many as five daughter cells.

According to researcher Dino Di Carlo, "We hope that this platform will allow us to better understand how the 3-D mechanical environment may play a role in the progression of a benign tumor into a malignant tumor that kills." The newly developed cancer cells in the study had either lost or gained extra chromosomes during division. Since most malignant tumors have cells that have lost chromosomes, the researchers believe that the platform will enable them to study how the environment helps to cause irregular cell division leading to chromosome loss.
