All living organisms are composed of cells . These cells grow and divide in a controlled manner in order for the organism to function properly. Changes in normal cells can cause them to grow uncontrollably. This uncontrollable growth is the hallmark of cancer cells.Normal cells have certain characteristics that are important for the proper functioning of tissues, organs, and body systems . These cells have the ability to reproduce correctly, stop reproducing when necessary, remain in a specific location, become specialized for specific functions, and self destruct when necessary.Cancer cells have characteristics that differ from normal cells.Cancer results from the development of abnormal properties in normal cells that enable them to grow excessively and spread to other locations. This abnormal development can be caused by mutations that occur from factors such as chemicals, radiation, ultraviolet light, and chromosome replication errors. These mutagens alter DNA by changing nucleotide bases and can even change the shape of DNA. The altered DNA produces errors in DNA replication, as well as errors in protein synthesis . These changes influence cell growth, cell division, and cell aging. Viruses also have the ability to cause cancer by altering cell genes. Cancer viruses change cells by integrating their genetic material with the host cell's DNA. The infected cell is regulated by the viral genes and gains the ability to undergo abnormal new growth. Several viruses have been linked to certain types of cancer in humans. The Epstein-Barr virus has been linked to Burkitt's lymphoma, the hepatitis B virus has been linked to liver cancer, and the human papilloma viruses have been linked to cervical cancer.
