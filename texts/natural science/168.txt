This mitosis quiz is designed to test your knowledge of mitotic cell division. Cell division is a process that enables organisms to grow and reproduce. Dividing cells go through an ordered series of events called the cell cycle Mitosis is a phase of the cell cycle in which the genetic material from a parent cell is divided equally between two daughter cells.Before a dividing cell enters mitosis it goes through a growth period called interphase . In this phase, the cell duplicates its genetic material and increases its organelles and cytoplasm Next, the cell enters the mitotic phase. Through a sequence of steps, chromosomes are equally distributed to two daughter cells.Mitosis consists of several stages: prophase anaphase , and telophase Finally, the dividing cell goes through cytokinesis (dividing of the cytoplasm) and two daughter cells are formed.Do you know the phase of the cell cycle in which a cell spends 90 percent of its time?
