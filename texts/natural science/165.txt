Meiosis is a two-part cell division process in organisms that sexually reproduce. In some respects, it is very similar to the process of mitosis Meiosis is divided into two parts: meiosis I and meiosis II. At the end of the meiotic process, there are four daughter cells rather than the two produced at the end of the mitotic process. Each of the resulting daughter cells has one half of the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.Test your knowledge of meiosis.
