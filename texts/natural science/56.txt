The word geography was invented by the ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes and literally means "writing about the earth." The word can be divided into two parts -andmeans the earth andrefers to writing.

Of course, geography today means much more than writing about the earth but it's a difficult discipline to define. Many geographers have done their best to define geography using a few words but a typical dictionary definition today reads, "The science of the earth's physical features, resources, climate, population, etc."
