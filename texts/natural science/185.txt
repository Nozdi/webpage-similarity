Frogs have a very interesting anatomy. They have highly specialized structures, such as a long, sticky tongue which they use to capture food. The anatomical structures of the bones in their upper and hind legs are also highly specialized for jumping and leaping.They have other structures however, that appear useless. Their weak teeth is an example of this.Frogs breathe through their skin when underwater. Oxygen in the water can pass through their porous skin and go directly to the blood. They also have a pair of lungs that allow them to breathe when on land.Frogs have a closed circulatory system containing a three-chambered heart with two atria and one ventricle. A valve within the heart, called the spiral valve, directs the flow of blood to prevent oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood from mixing.Frogs have a highly developed sense of hearing. They can detect high-pitched sounds with their ears and low-pitched sounds through their skin.They also have a highly developed sense of sight and smell. Frogs can detect predators and prey using their large eyes that protrude from their head. They use their keen sense of smell to detect chemical signals that help them identify potential food.These images of the frog oral cavity and internal anatomy are designed to help you identify various structures of the male and female frog.This quiz is designed to help you identify internal and external structures in the male and female frog.
