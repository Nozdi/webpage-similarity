The Burj Khalifa building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates is the world's tallest building. Completed in January 2010 with 160 stories which reach 2,716 feet (828 meters) high, it is a mix of Hotel/Residential/Office.

Since its completion in January 2010, the tallest building in the world has been the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

However, the building called Kingdom Tower, proposed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is expected to be built from 2012 to 2018 and would move Burj Khalifa to the second place spot. Kingdom Tower is expected to be the world's first building that is taller than a kilometer (1000 meters or 3281 feet).

Currently proposed as the world's second tallest building is Sky City in Changsha, China to be built by 2015. One World Trade Center in New York City is also nearly complete and will be the world's third tallest building when it opens sometime in 2014.

Thus, this list is extremely dynamic and by 2020, the world's current third tallest building, Taipei 101, is expected to be around the 20th tallest building in the world due to numerous tall buildings being proposed or constructed in China, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia.
