In this dihybrid cross, a plant with the dominant traits of green pod color and yellow seed color is cross-pollinated with a plant with the recessive traits of yellow pod color and green seed color.If a true-breeding plant with green pod color (GG) and yellow seed color (YY) is cross-pollinated with a true-breeding plant with yellow pod color (gg) and green seeds (yy), the resulting offspring will all be heterozygous for green pod color and yellow seeds (GgYy).
