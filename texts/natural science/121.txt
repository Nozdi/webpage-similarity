Reber was an American amateur radio operator and astronomer who built the first radio telescope. After learning about Karl Jansky's discovery of radio signals from space, he built a 9-meter dish receiver in his back yard. He began a systematic mapping of radio frequencies of the night sky. His success began the radio observatory boom of modern astronomy.

Harline was an American physiologist who shares the 1967 Nobel Prize in Medicine with George Wald and Ragnar Granit for their research into the neurological mechanics of vision. He investigated the electrical activity of the retinas of mollusks and arthropods. He found the photoreceptor cells are linked and suppress signals by their neighbors so they can work together and refine the contrast and clarity of the image.

Wollaston was an British chemist who developed the first method of producing pure platinum from ore. He also discovered the elements palladium and rhodium while researching platinum. He was the first to observe the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum which led to the discovery of the elements in the Sun.
