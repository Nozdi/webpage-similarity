On January 1, 1999 one of the largest steps toward European unification took place with the introduction of the euro as the official currency in eleven countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain).

However, residents of the first European Union countries that adopted the euro didn't begin using euro banknotes and coins until January 1, 2002.

Today, the euro is one of the world's most powerful currencies, used by more than 320 million Europeans in twenty-four countries. The countries currently using the euro are:

On January 1, 2009, Slovakia started using the euro. Estonia began using the euro on January 1, 2011. Latvia began using the euro as its currency on January 1, 2014.

Lithuania is expected to join the Eurozone in the next few years and thus become a new country using the euro.

Only 18 of the 27 members of the European Union (EU) are part of the Eurozone, the name for the collection of EU countries that utilize the euro. Notably, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden have thus far decided not to convert to the euro. Other new EU member countries are working toward becoming part of the Eurozone.

On the other hand, Andorra, Kosovo, Montenegro, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City are not EU members but do officially use the euro as their currencies.
