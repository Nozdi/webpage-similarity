The chemical element photo gallery is a great way for students and anyone else to see what the elements really look like. However, I was unable to find images of all the elements. Some are radioactive and possibly never photographed, but other elements on the list may be something you have seen.In addition to elements with no photos, any help finding better images of the rare earths would be greatly appreciated.

To submit a photo, you can e-mail me at chemistry@aboutguide.com with either a link to a public domain photo available on the net, or if it is your own photo, e-mail the jpg or gif attachment and a statement that permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify the image (for public domain use or licensed to About, whichever you prefer).
