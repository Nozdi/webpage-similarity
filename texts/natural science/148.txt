Researchers have discovered several new species of Aleiodes wasps that parasitize caterpillars and actually mummify them. These wasps were found in Ecuador and mummify their victims, specific caterpillars, by injecting their eggs into them. The developing wasp larva feeds on the caterpillar, causing the caterpillar to mummify. Once fully developed, the wasp cuts an opening in the mummified remains and flies away.

According to researcher Scott Shaw, "Killing and mummifying caterpillars may sound bad, but these are actually highly beneficial insects. These wasps are helping to naturally control the populations of plant-feeding caterpillars, so they help to sustain the biodiversity of tropical forests." Aleiodes wasps are very small, measuring about 4 to 9 millimeters in length. Many of the 24 newly discovered insect species were named after celebrities and include the Jimmy Fallon wasp and Shakira wasp.
