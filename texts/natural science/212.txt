A chromosome is a long, stringy aggregate of genes that carries heredity information ( DNA ) and is formed from condensed chromatin . A non-duplicated chromosome is single-stranded and is comprised of a centromere region that connects two arm regions. The short arm region is called the p arm and the long arm region is called the q arm. The end region of a chromosome is called a telomere. Telomeres consist of repeating non-coding DNA sequences that get shorter as a cell divides.A duplicated chromosome is comprised of two identical chromosomes called sister chromatids that are connected at the centromere region. Chromosomes are located within the nucleus of our cells
