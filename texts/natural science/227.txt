Researchers have reconstructed the genome for the bacterium responsible for the Black Death plague. The bacterium is a variant of the Yersinia pestis bacterium which is known to cause the plague today. The Black Death took the lives of 50 million Europeans in the mid 1300s. In the study, the researchers were able to retrieve bacterial DNA from the skeletal remains of Black Death victims. After purifying and analyzing DNA from dental material, they were able to reconstruct the Black Death bacterium genome.

According to geneticist and researcher Hendrik Poinar, "The genomic data show that this bacterial strain, or variant, is the ancestor of all modern plagues we have today worldwide. Every outbreak across the globe today stems from a descendant of the medieval plague. With a better understanding of the evolution of this deadly pathogen, we are entering a new era of research into infectious disease." The researchers state that after over 600 years, the genome of the bacterium has had relatively few changes. Future studies will be directed at determining why the bacterium was so lethal.
