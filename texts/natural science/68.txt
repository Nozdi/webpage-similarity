The ancient Greek scholar Eratosthenes was the first to use the word geography and is widely know for being the "father of geography."

While serving as the head librarian and scholar at the Great Library at Alexandria in 240, Eratosthenes wrote a comprehensive treatise about the world, called Geography. Eratosthenes also measured the circumference of the earth to be 25,000 miles, just 100 miles over the actual circumference at the equator (24,901 miles).
