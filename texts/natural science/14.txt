The world's tallest buildings keep getting taller. Take a look at my just-updated list of the world's 20 tallest buildings. I'm sure you'll be surprised by what you discover. Several, as high as number two in the rankings, opened in the last two years and they're pushing out long-standing records held by notables such at the Petronas Towers, Willis (Sears Tower), and now even the Empire State building is 20th on the list, soon to be displaced by the soon-to-be third tallest One World Trade Center.
