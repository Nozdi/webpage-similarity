The corpus callosum is a thick band of nerve fibers that divides the cerebrum into left and right hemispheres. It connects the left and right sides of the brain allowing for communication between both hemispheres. This being said, what happens when a person is born without a corpus callosum? Researchers from the California Institute of Technology have demonstrated through functional magnetic resonance imaging, that people with a condition called agenesis of the corpus callosum, or AgCC, still have the ability to communicate across brain hemispheres.

According to researcher J. Michael Tyszka, "This was a real surprise. We expected to see a lot less coupling between the left and right brain in this group -- after all, they are missing about 200 million connections that would normally be there." The study showed that resting state brain activity in both those with healthy brains and those with AgCC looks essentially the same. This indicates that the brain compensates for the missing corpus callosum by rewiring itself and establishing new nerve connections between the brain hemispheres. The actual process involved in establishing this communication is still unknown.
