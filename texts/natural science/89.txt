At some point over the last few decades, someone started a notion to alarm people that population growth was out of control. Whoever it was said that a majority of the humans who have ever lived were alive today. Well, that's a gross overestimate.

Most studies place the total number of human beings to have ever lived at 60 billion to 120 billion and since the world population right now is a mere 6 billion, the percent of humans who have ever lived and are alive today is anywhere from a mere 5 to 10 percent.
