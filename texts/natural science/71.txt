With a minimum national elevation of 4,530 feet (1380 meters) above sea level, Lesotho holds the record for the world's highest minimum elevation. Lesotho's lowest point lies in the Orange River valley but most of the country's land lies above 6,000 feet (1830 meters).

Many of the world's non-landlocked countries have minimum elevations of 0 feet above sea level since they touch the ocean or sea at sea level. Some countries also have points on land that have an elevation below sea level.
