On May 24, 1970, drilling began at the Kola Superdeep Bore. This project was an attempt to drill as deep as technologically possible. Several branching holes were drilled with the deepest reaching 7.6 miles into the Earth's crust. Several surprises were found on the way down. Seismic sonar mapping showed that seismic waves move faster below 2 miles and geologists expected a 'basement' layer where granite changes to basalt. They found instead the rock was changed by the heat and pressure. They also found the rock to be saturated with water. Another unexpected find was the discovery of microfossils of plankton from 4 miles down.Ultimately, the largest surprise would be what would stop the drilling. They found the temperature rose much more quickly than expected. They thought they were going to encounter 100 degC rock at the 7 mile mark, but really found 180 degC temperatures. The rocks tended to act like a plastic at that pressure and temperature and the hole would fill in when the drill bits were pulled out to be replaced. Drilling stopped at 40,230 feet.Find out what else occurred on this day in science history Follow About.com Chemistry on Facebook or Twitter.
