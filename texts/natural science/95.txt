The periodic table of the elements contains a wide variety of information such as element symbols, atomic number and atomic mass is most common, but the periodic table can contain even more data than previously expected. This will show you how to use a periodic table to gather information about the elements.The periodic table contains informative cells for each element arranged by increasing atomic number and chemical properties. Each element's cell typically contains:The horizontal rows are called periods. Each period indicates the highest energy level the electrons of that element occupies at its ground state.The vertical columns are called groups. Each element in a group has the same number of valence electrons and typically behave in a similar manner when bonding with other elements. The bottom two rows, the lanthanides and actinides all belong to the 3B group and are listed separately.Many periodic tables identify element types using different colors for different element types. These include the alkali metals halogens and noble gases A good periodic table is a great tool for solving chemistry problems. You can use an online periodic table or print your own
