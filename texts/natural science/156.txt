The cell wall is the rigid, semi-permeable protective layer in some cell types. This outer covering is positioned next to the cell membrane (plasma membrane) in most plant cells , fungi, bacteria , algae, and some archaea Animal cells however, do not have a cell wall. The cell wall conducts many important functions in a cell including protection, structure, and support. Cell wall composition varies depending on the organism. In plants, the cell wall is composed mainly of strong fibers of the carbohydrate polymer. Cellulose is the major component of cotton fiber and wood and is used in paper production.The plant cell wall is multi-layered and consists of up to three sections. From the outermost layer of the cell wall, these layers are identified as the middle lamella, primary cell wall, and secondary cell wall. While all plant cells have a middle lamella and primary cell wall, not all have a secondary cell wall.A major role of the cell wall is to form a framework for the cell to prevent over expansion. Cellulose fibers, structural proteins, and other polysaccharides help to maintain the shape and form of the cell. Additional functions of the cell wall include:To learn more about organelles that can be found in typical plant cells, see:
