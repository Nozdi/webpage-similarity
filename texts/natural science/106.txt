Chemistry is a huge field, commonly broken up into various subjects. Learn about the different subjects of chemistry, such as organic chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, physical chemistry, and analytical chemistry.

Originally, chemical engineering was a marriage between chemistry and mechanical engineering. Chemical engineering involves the practical application to solve problems, usually in industry.

Organic chemistry involves the study of carbon and its reactions.

Analytical chemistry is concerned with describing and quantifying chemical processes. An analytical chemist may examine the composition of materials or may develop new techniques to study chemistry.

Physical chemists apply physics to analyze chemistry. The areas of physics most often seem in physical chemistry are thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

Biochemistry examines the chemical reactions inside living organisms. Learn about amino acids, anabolic and catabolic reactions, vitamins, transcription, and other important biochemical processes.
