The Kona Coffee Belt is a narrow strip of a mere 4,000 acres of land that produces some of the best-tasting coffee in the world. This coffee-growing microclimate is approximately two miles by twenty-seven miles, and runs along the picturesque Kona Coast. Today, the Kona Coffee Belt is home to hundreds of small coffee farms, most about three to five acres in size, many locally run by families.
