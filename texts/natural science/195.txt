Gametes are reproductive cells that unite during sexual reproduction to form a new cell called a zygote. In humans, male gametes are sperm and female gametes are ova (eggs). Sperm are motile and have a long, tail-like projection called a flagellum . Ova however, are non-motile and relatively large in comparison to the male gamete.Gametes are produced by a type of cell division called meiosis . They are haploid , meaning that they contain only one set of chromosomes . When the haploid male and female gametes unite in a process called fertilization, they form what is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid and contains two sets of chromosomes.
