An ancient Greek kingdom called Macedonia and Macedon existed from the fourth through second centuries B.C.E. and three regions of Greece today carry the Macedonia name (Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Central Macedonia, and Western Macedonia). When the Republic of Macedonia declared its independence in 1991 from the Former Yugoslavia, Greece was unhappy about the use of the name Macedonia. Greece blocked trade to Macedonia (which is a neighboring country) from 1991 to 1995, when the two countries signed an agreement of understanding.

Today, Macedonia is officially known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or FYRM for short.
