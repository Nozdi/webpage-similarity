How to Find a Graduate Program in Geography 

 It's easy to find the right grad school in geography for you, just by following some simple steps. Think about which specialties of geography you're most interested in. If you're interested in becoming faculty at a university, consider the Ph.D., otherwise, maybe a masters degree is a good place to start. Obtain a copy of the Association of American Geographers' latest [i]Guide to Programs in Geography/AAG Handbook and Directory of Geographers[/i] from the AAG, a professor, or your library. Use the grid at the end of the program listing in the [i]Guide[/i] to find schools that meet your interests and that are in the appropriate regions. Narrow down the list by reading each university's self-submitted description, their size, and whether they offer the degree you're interested in. Once you have a short list, explore those departments' web sites and further refine your list. Once you have a manageable number of schools, request program information and applications via mail. Visit the schools you'd probably attend, if accepted. Apply and wait for your acceptance letters. Good luck! 

 It's very important to visit the schools you're interested in, even if they don't require interviews. You have a much better chance of being accepted if you have communicated with faculty member at your intended school about your interests. Meeting them is even better. The out-of-print book, [i]On Becoming a Professional Geographer[/i], edited by Martin S. Kenzer (1989), is an excellent resource.
