Joliot-Curie was a French physicist who shares the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with his wife, Irene for the the synthesis of artificial isotopes. They exposed different elements to alpha radiation and found new isotopes of other elements that were normally not radioactive.

Sabatier was a French chemist who advanced the understanding of catalysts. He was awarded half the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his method of hydrogenating organic compounds in the presence of metallic powder catalysts. He is also known for the Sabatier reaction where hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide under high temperature and pressure to create methane and water using nickel as a catalyst. The Sabatier principle of catalysts states the interactions between catalyst and substrate should not be too strong or too weak.

Ernest is a Swiss physical chemist who was awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. He changed the radio frequency waves that previously were used in NMR with short, powerful pulses of energy. This process greatly improved the range and resolution of the device.

Keynes is a British physiologist who researched the chemical pathways of nerve impulses. He was the first to trace the movement of sodium and potassium ions in nerve tissue through the use of radioisotopes of sodium and potassium.

Dempster was a Canadian-American physicist who designed and built the first mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometers are used to separate a sample's components by mass. He later used this device to discover the uranium isotope U-235, the main isotope used in atomic bombs.
