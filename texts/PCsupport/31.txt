Now that the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool is installed, you'll need to open it to start the process. At least with most computers, the installation you completed in the last step created a shortcut on the Desktop called Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. Open that. Tip: Having trouble finding the shortcut? The icon it uses looks like a folder with a download arrow and shield, as shown above. If you're presented with a User Account Control prompt after opening, tap or click Yes to continue.
