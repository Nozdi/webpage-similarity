IMPORTANT UPDATE: This process is no longer valid or necessary with the release of Windows 8.1 on October 17, 2013. Beginning with Windows 8.1, Microsoft no longer sells upgrade licensed versions of Windows 8 for download, only full retail versions. Purchase a download or boxed copy of Windows 8.1 here, or see Where Can I Download Windows 8 or 8.1? for more options.

Previously Valid Instructions: I have always recommended a clean install over an upgrade install for every version of Windows, and that's no different with Windows 8. A clean install, or "custom" install, means an installation of Windows 8 from a formatted drive. As cumbersome as backing up your data beforehand and then restoring it and reinstalling all of your software afterwards may be, your new Windows 8 setup will likely be much more stable than it would have been had you performed an in-place upgrade. Note: This process is intended to help you get your downloaded Windows 8 or Windows 8 Pro Upgrade prepared so that you can perform a clean install. If you have any sort of retail version (a non-upgrade version) of Windows 8, you can skip on to How To Clean Install Windows 8 for the complete walkthrough. Important: Even though you're going to completely remove it, your computer must already have Windows on it if you want to install an upgrade licensed copy of Windows 8. See my Installing Windows 8 FAQ for more on this, plus answers to some other questions you might be having right now. Difficulty: Moderate Time Required: This process should take around 30 to 90 minutes, on average, depending on the speed of your Internet connection. This time estimate does not including the actual clean install process, which I link to in the last step. Here's How:
