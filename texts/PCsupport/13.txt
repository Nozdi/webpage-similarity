Click the Download button to start the Windows 8.1 download process. Windows 8.1 is a major update to Windows 8 and so it's no surprise that it requires a large download. I'm updating a 32-bit version of Windows 8 Pro and the download size is 2.81 GB. The size of the download will differ somewhat If your edition or architecture is different than mine, but all will be several GB in size. As it states on the Windows 8.1 download screen you're looking at now, you can keep working while the update is downloading. Note: I'm updating Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro in this tutorial but the steps apply equally if upgrading Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 (the standard edition).
