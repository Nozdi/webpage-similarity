Let me first preface all of the following with this: updates provided by Microsoft rarely cause problems. This includes those pushed out on Patch Tuesday and others made optionally available in Windows Update. I said rarely, not never. Ask anyone with a house full of nonworking computers the day after Patch Tuesday and you'll swear that Microsoft deliberately sabotaged the world's computers running Windows. Again, problems don't occur that often and are rarely widespread, but when they do they hurt. Luckily there are some really simple things you can do to minimize the chance that a patch from Microsoft will do more harm than good: Tip: If it's too late and the damage is done, see How To Fix Problems Caused by Windows Updates for help. Now that your automatic update settings are changed, you've recently restarted your computer, and you're pretty sure System Restore is working, you can actually get these updates installed: Please let me know if you have reason to believe that another step is worthy of inclusion above. I'll consider anything that might help prevent problems caused, or seemingly caused, by Windows Update.
