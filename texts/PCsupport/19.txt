One particularly frustrating way in which your computer might not start is when you encounter an issue during the Windows startup process but have nothing to go on - no Blue Screen of Death or other error message. Maybe Windows 7 hangs on startup, forcing you to look at "Starting Windows" for a hour. You're forced to restart manually, only to watch it freeze at the same place again. Or maybe your Windows 8 computer restarts automatically sometime after it begins to load, causing what's called a "reboot loop." Sometimes your computer might even stop at a point where you can move your mouse around but nothing happens. Windows might seem like it's still trying to start but eventually you have to manually reboot your computer, only to see the same behavior again! Note: If you see a blue screen full of information flash on the screen before your computer reboots, this is a Blue Screen of Death and your computer happens to be configured to reboot after one. See How To Fix a Blue Screen of Death instead of this guide. Important: If your PC is in fact booting to the Windows login screen, you see any kind of error message, or if you're not even getting past the POST, see How To Fix a Computer That Won't Turn On for a better troubleshooting guide for your specific problem.
