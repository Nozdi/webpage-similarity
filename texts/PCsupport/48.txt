Here's where we begin the real work of getting that Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 file in ISO format transferred to your flash drive or other USB storage device. To do this, you'll need to download a free tool from Microsoft called the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. Don't worry that Windows 7 is in then name. Yes, it was originally designed for use as a way of getting a Windows 7 ISO onto a flash drive, but it works perfectly fine for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 ISO images. Download the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool Tip: The name of the file you'll be downloading is Windows7-USB-DVD-tool.exe, it is 2.6 MB in size, and comes from the http://images2.store.microsoft.com server. With the help of this program, over the next several steps, we'll get the flash drive properly formatted and the Windows 8 installation files properly copied to it. Once complete, you'll be able to use this flash drive to install Windows 8. Important: While it may be tempting to try, you can't just copy the contents of the ISO file, nor the ISO file itself, to the flash drive and expect to boot from it and install Windows 8. It's a little more complicated than that, thus the existence of this tool.
