Windows Update is a service by Microsoft that makes it really easy to get the newest patches and service packs installed in Windows XP. On most computers, these updates download and install automatically, usually on Patch Tuesday. But what if you don't want updates to install automatically? Some Windows XP users, especially those who have experienced issues with automatic updates in the past, would rather have more manual control over what updates get installed and when. Luckily, you actually have quite a bit of control surrounding automatic updates and making changes is really easy. Difficulty: Easy Time Required: Making changes to Windows Update settings in Windows XP will only take a minute or so.
