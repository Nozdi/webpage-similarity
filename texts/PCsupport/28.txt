Question: Where Can I Find The Windows XP Serial Key? Looking for your Windows XP serial key? Keeping track of your Windows XP serial key might not have seemed too important before that system crash but you need the XP serial key that came with your copy of the Windows XP operating system before you can reinstall it. Answer: You can find your Windows XP serial key in the Windows Registry. Please note, however, that the Windows XP serial key is encrypted in the Windows Registry, making it nearly impossible to find manually. Luckily, there is a way to decode and display the key. The easiest way to find your Windows XP serial key is to download a free key finder program. Product key finder programs automatically search your computer for your Windows XP serial key. Important: Keep in mind that your XP serial key will only be found if you run it on a computer with Windows XP still installed.
