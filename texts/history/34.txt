Most of the events listed by date on this calendar come from H.H. Scullard's Festival and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic.

Using the Roman division into days before the Kalends, Nones, and Ides (instead of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday) makes this a perpetual calendar.

See How to convert to Roman Dates for more on the conventions surrounding use of Nones, Ides, and Kalends.
