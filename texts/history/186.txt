Under the consuls Titus Quinctius Flamininus and then Manius Acilius Glabrio, Rome fought the Seleucid War against Antiochus, king of Syria from 192-188 B.C. During the Macedonian Wars , Antiochus and Philip V of Macedon had been allies, taking chunks of Greece and the Greek cities in Asia Minor until the Romans stepped in to grant Greece its freedom. Such alliances were made for convenience. Philip seems to have ignored the alliance when Rome seemed the more likely victor. He seems to have granted Rome access to Macedonia's territory because the Romans arrived in Gonni, which they couldn't have done without Philip's help. This made the odds decidedly worse for Antiochus. Antiochus retreated and faced the Romans at Thermopylae , near the famous pass where the Spartans and their allies had once met the Persians. Unlike the routed Spartans, Antiochus survived. The treaty he signed with Rome gave the territory he had taken in Greece back to the Greeks. Antiochus was confined to Syria.
