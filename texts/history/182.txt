How old is old enough to be a ruler? Is there an age before which there is bound to be trouble? Looking at the callous behavior of several of the young Roman emperors it's hard not to wonder if too much power was thrust upon immature shoulders. The following table of the Age of Accession of the Roman Emperors was created because of a forum discussion of the relationship between the relative youth of the emperor and his unfitness to rule.

Please add your thoughts to this discussion. Do you think youth or old age was more of a problem for the Roman emperors? Did age at accession of the emperor make any difference?

The table shows the approximate age at accession of the Roman emperors. For those emperors with no birth information, the approximate date of accession and the birth year are marked with question marks. Consult the resources for more exact information.

Unless otherwise indicated, all dates are A.D.
