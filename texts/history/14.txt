Question: What is the Monroe Doctrine?

During Monroe's seventh annual message to Congress on December 2, 1823, he created what has since been called the Monroe Doctrine, one of the most important foreign policy doctrines in American History. With this doctrine, he made it clear that there would be no European colonization in the Americas or any interference with independent states. Presidents have used this doctrine through the years as they have asserted to right to intervene in nations in this hemisphere. For example, John Tyler cited it as he seized Texas for America. Theodore Roosevelt extended the doctrine with the Roosevelt Corollary which basically stated that European nations could not use force in Latin America to collect debts.

Interestingly enough, the roots of isolationism that caused reticence to enter 'European' conflicts such as World War I and World War II can also be found in this speech where Monroe states, "In the wars of the European powers, in matters relating to themselves, we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy to do so. It is only when our rights are invaded, or seriously menaced, that we resent injuries, or make preparation for our defence." Monroe also asserts that the US policy in regards to Europe is "...not to interfere in the internal concerns of any of its powers; to consider the government de facto as the legitimate government for us; to cultivate friendly relations with it, and to preserve those relations by a frank, firm, and manly policy; meeting, in all instances, the just claims of every power; submitting to injuries from none."
