At 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906, a large earthquake hit San Francisco. Although the earthquake only lasted approximately 40 to 60 seconds, the damage was severe. The earthquake caused chimneys to fall, walls to cave in, and gas lines to break. Asphalt that covered the streets buckled and piled up. Many people didn't even have time to even get out of bed before they were killed by falling debris.

Even greater than the damage caused directly by the earthquake, the city was ravaged by fire for four days. With most water mains broken, the fires spread across the city, nearly unchecked.

The quake and subsequent fire left more than half San Francisco's population homeless, destroyed 28,000 buildings, and killed approximately 700 to 3,000 people.

Below is a collection of historic photographs of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, showing damage from both the earthquake and the fire. Also included are pictures of people fleeing the city, refugee camps, and street kitchens.
