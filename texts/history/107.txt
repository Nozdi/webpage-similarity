The Vietnam War was the struggle over Vietnam from 1959 to 1975 between the communist Vietnamese forces in North Vietnam who wanted an end to all foreign occupation of their country and the United States (allied with South Vietnam) who wanted to prohibit any expansion of communism. The prolonged war left many Americans bitter about U.S. involvement in a war they could not win.
