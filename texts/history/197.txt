The Temple of Castor and Pollux was finished c. 484 B.C. During the Republic it served as a Senate meeting place. The front of the podium at the Temple of Castor and Pollux served as a speaker's platform. It was destroyed in 14 B.C. and rebuilt by Tiberius.

Castor and Pollux are also called the Dioscuri or Polydeuces. In Greek mythology they are the twin brothers of Helen and Clytemnestra. In Rome, the Dioscuri were worshiped as gods. By social convention, Women would swear by Castor. Castor and Pollux were thought to have helped the Romans in the Battle of Lake Regillus.
