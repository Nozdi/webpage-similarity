Archaeological remains can tell us about the ancient Greeks from before recorded history. It is conventional to start the history of the early Greeks with the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans. Following these was (also conventionally) a period described as a Dark Age, followed by the periods with written records, beginning with the Archaic Age and proceeding through the Classical, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine and modern eras. The Byzantine era is usually counted as part of the Middle Ages (and of course the modern period is beyond even that), and so beyond the scope of this site. Here are major topics to know in connection with the earlier periods of Greek history.
