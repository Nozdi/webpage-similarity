Hannibal's Children, by Historical fiction writer John Maddox Roberts, is the first volume of a story about how Rome regains its empire after Hannibal -- contrary-to-fact -- won the Second Punic War.

The alternate world of Hannibal's Children, by John Maddox Roberts, makes a lot of sense. Hannibal was winning the Second Punic War and the Romans counted Hannibal's victory at Cannae as the worst defeat of the Roman Republic, so the story that the Romans were expelled from Italy by Hannibal is plausible. And they probably would have kept up their training and preparation for getting their own back, just as Roberts depicts. However, a little more attention to characters and even transitions between scenes would have helped immensely with the readability of Hannibal's Children.

Like other military fiction written with an eye to Hollywood, the story is bigger than life and filled with exquisite costumes and choreographically-trained legions.
