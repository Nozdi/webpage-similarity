Here are a number of key quotes from Lyndon B. Johnson, America's 36th president.

"If you've got 'em by the balls, their heart and mind will follow."

"Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid. Well, by God, I'm going to Vietnam's aid."

"We must throw open the doors of opportunity. But we also must equip our people to walk through these doors."

"We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. We have talked for one hundred years or more. It is time now to write it in the books of law."

"The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents.... It is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods."

"To conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts."

"Once we considered education a public expense; we know now that it is a public investment."

"It is important that the United States remain a two-party system. I'm a fellow who likes small parties and the Republican Party can't be too small to suit me."

"If we quit Vietnam, tomorrow we'll be fighting in Hawaii, and next week we'll have to fight in San Francisco."

"The separation of church and state is a source of strength, but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the Supreme Being."
