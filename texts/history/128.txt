When NASA announced that it would be sending men to the moon, one of the questions that floated around was what was Neil Armstrong's first words going to be once he stepped onto the moon?

Some magazines, such as Esquire, asked popular people of the day what they thought Armstrong should say. Thousands of other people wrote letters to Armstrong with their own recommendations.

When Armstrong took his first step on the moon on July 20, 1969, he declared, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." Or, at least, that is what it sounded to all the people back on earth.

However, it seemed as though Armstrong had missed a word. Before the word "man," there was supposed to be the letter "a." The line was supposed to read, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."

In 2006, an analysis was made of the tapes of the now famous phrase and it was determined that there was a bit of static just at the point where the "a" might have been. So, although it is entirely non-conclusive, Armstrong might have actually said the line correctly.

One wonders, however, if it really matters. The statement was obviously powerful enough that even most school kids know where it was said. Isn't that more than can be said for nearly every other historical achievement?
