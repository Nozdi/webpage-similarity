The date at which you start or end a Fall of Rome timeline is subject to debate and interpretation [see Fall of Rome - Why Did Rome Fall?]. This Fall of Rome timeline uses standard events and marks the end with Gibbon's conventionally accepted date for the fall of Rome in A.D. 476. Although one could start the decline with the reign of Marcus Aurelius' successor, his son, Commodus, the period of imperial crisis is a compelling choice and easy to understand as a starting point. So this timeline begins just before the east-west splitting of the Roman Empire, a time described as chaotic, and ends when the last Roman emperor was deposed, but allowed to live out his life in retirement.
