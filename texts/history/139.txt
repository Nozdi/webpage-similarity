Achilles was the greatest hero to the Greeks in the Trojan War, but Hercules overcame so many obstacles that it is hard to rank him second to any. Besides, in Iliad I Nestor says that all the heroes of the Trojan War are second rate compared with earlier ones like Theseus. This list is mine, however, and 21st century prejudices are in play, so Achilles supersedes Theseus. In this list I will show the major claim to fame of each of these heroes.
