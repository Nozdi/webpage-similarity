'This Day in Ancient History' lists events, festivals, births, deaths, coronations, and more for ancient history. Some dates contain anniversaries for modern (19-21st century) writers who have contributed to the fields of Classics and Ancient History. Most events are Roman because their calendar corresponds most closely to our own. Dates from the Greek and Egyptian calendars are only approximate. Dates continue to be debated.
