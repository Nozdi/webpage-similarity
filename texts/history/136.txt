Most of the Roman and Greek Gods and Goddesses share enough attributes to be considered roughly the same, but with a different name -- Latin for the Roman, Greek for the Greek. Some of the Roman and Greek gods and goddesses -- Apollo, for instance -- have only the one name for both.

For a more complete Roman listing, see Roman Gods and Goddesses. For more on the Greek gods, see Olympian Greek Gods and Goddesses.

Please note that there are different cults for many of these deities, so, for instance, the Ephesian Artemis/Diana is quite different from the huntress Artemis (Artemis Agrotera).
