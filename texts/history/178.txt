Apollodorus wrote a famous speech denouncing a well-known retired courtesan named Neaira, but who she was, how she lived, and why Apollodorus was out to get her were not well known. Debra Hamel has recreated a more complete story of Neaira turning her family's relationship with Apollodorus into a mystery story, the solution to which each reader must decide on his own.

In ancient Greece, the respectable women were shut away in the women's quarters. If a woman showed up at dinner, she was presumed to be a courtesan. Thus, in one sense, a courtesan was freer than a Greek matron, but this freedom came at a price, which Debra Hamel capably shows. The courtesan did not have much choice about who used her body. She couldn't marry a citizen. She didn't have much of a career after she hit twenty. Neaira managed to make men fight over her (legally) well beyond the normal age at which her attractiveness was presumed to fade and finally found a man who would fight for her reputation in court. Or would he? Ultimately, we don't really know if her life's partner, Stephanos, was able to do more against Apollodorus than incite his wrath, which he took out on Neaira. Debra Hamel looks at all the evidence and presents cogent arguments -- where possible -- to support the idea that Neaira, her partner Stephanos, and his daughter Phanos were not guilty of the charges against them.
