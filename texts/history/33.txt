Of the 44 men who have been President of the United States, there are some truly clear choices of who were the most important and influential presidents. There were also many who would never have made the list. My picks for the top 10 influential presidents were based on their historical influence and their actions while in office. This was a tough list to create -- especially once we move past the 7th president. If one more could be added it would be Ronald Reagan. He helped bring the Cold War to an end after years of struggle. He definitely gets an honorable mention for this list of influential Presidents.

As the first President, Washington couldn't help but set precedents that were followed by later Presidents. His lack of a desire to be seen as a 'monarch' was an extremely important part of creating a citizen President. Also, the fact that he retired after two terms set a precedent only broken by Franklin Roosevelt. After Roosevelt's death, the two-term limit was added as the 22nd amendment to the Constitution.

Through Thomas Jefferson's Louisiana Purchase , the size of the United States doubled overnight. Jefferson was a strong states' rightest who also realized the need for consolidating power in the federal government in certain instances.

After Thomas Jefferson, James K. Polk increased the size of the United States more than any other president through the acquisition of California and New Mexico as a result of the Mexican-American War. He also claimed Oregon Territory after a treaty with England. He was a key figure in manifest destiny . He was also an extremely effective leader during the Mexican War . He is considered to be the best one-term president.
