This page of dates for major events in ancient history is a fine place for you to start your exploration of the ancient world: you would be wasting your time if you tried to read about ancient history without having any idea of the timeline of major events. (Similarly, please consult maps or an historical atlas.) You need to know, for instance, who came first: Julius Caesar or Alexander the Great; and which came first: Alexander's conquest of Persia or the Persian Wars.

This timeline shows many such major events in ancient history.

You may use this major events timeline in one of two ways: You may consult it, preferably often enough that you know the sequence of events, or you may memorize dates and names. The first method is easier; the second more old-fashioned, but both have their virtues. Feel free to adapt this for personal use by adding to these 60 events and dates.

Many of the events in this timeline are only approximate or traditional. This is particularly true of the events before Greece and Rome, but even with Greece and Rome, the early years are in doubt.
