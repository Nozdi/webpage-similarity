On the road towards the American Revolution, the American colonists were pulled into a number of wars that began in Europe. King George's War was the American name for the War of Austrian Succession that lasted from 1740-1748. Coinciding with and then subsumed into this war was the War of Jenkin's Ear (1739-1743) fought between Spain and England over shipping concerns. As with the other wars before these (King William's War and Queen Anne's War), the results of the war did nothing to solve the serious boundary disputes between England and France. The two countries would meet again in the French and Indian War. The monetary costs of carrying out warfare on both continents would result in taxes being raised and the introduction of more direct supervision of the colonies. These in turn would lead to the rise of individuals such as Samuel Adams and Thomas Paine would lead the charge against these actions. Ultimately, the colonists would air their grievances with the Declaration of Independence.
