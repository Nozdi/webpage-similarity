While serving as a US Representative, he joined the navy to fight in World War II. He was an observer on a bombing mission where the plane's generator went out and they had to turn around. Some accounts said there was enemy contact while others said there was none. Despite this, he was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in battle.

In 1937, Johnson was elected as a representative. In 1949, he wan a seat in the US Senate. By 1955, at the age of forty-six, he became the youngest Democratic majority leader up to that time. He held a lot of power in Congress due to his participation on the appropriations, finance, and armed services committees. He served in the Senate until 1961 when he became Vice President.

John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Johnson took over as president, taking the oath of office on Air Force One. He finished the term and then ran again in 1964, defeating Barry Goldwater in the process with 61 percent of the popular vote.

Johnson called his package of programs that he wanted put through the "Great Society." They were designed to help the poor and provide additional protections. They included Medicare and Medicaid programs, environmental protection acts, civil rights acts, and consumer protection acts.

Johnson was known as a master politician. Once he became president, he initially found some difficulty in getting acts he wanted passed pushed through. However, he used his personal political power to persuade, or some say strong arm, many laws he wished passed through Congress.

When Johnson became president, no official military action was being taken in Vietnam. However, as his terms progressed, more and more troops were sent to the region. By 1968, 550,000 American troops were embroiled in the Vietnam Conflict. When Johnson became president, no official military action was being taken in Vietnam. However, as his terms progressed, more and more troops were sent to the region. By 1968, 550,000 American troops were embroiled in the Vietnam Conflict. At home, Americans were divided over the war. As time went by, it became obvious that America was not going to win due not only to the guerrilla fighting they faced but also because America did not want to escalate the war further than it had to. When Johnson decided not to run for reelection in 1968, he stated that he was going to try to get peace with the Vietnamese. However, this would not happen until Richard Nixon's presidency.

After retiring, Johnson did not work in politics again. He spent some time writing his memoirs, The Vantage Point. This book provides a look and some say self justification for many of the actions he took while he was president.
