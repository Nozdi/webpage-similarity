When the media represents "this day in history," events from antiquity are rare. See for yourself: check the following links for several days. Rarely will you see a date from before the landing of the pilgrims.

In the U.S. this can be partly explained by the same patriotism that makes two hundred years of US history dominate the primary and secondary curriculum.Another explanation for the shortage comes from a lack of verifiable dates. As David Meadows writes:Given the sometimes arbitrary nature of date assignment, those of us who have events calendars often must make guesses. Even so, there is a remarkable shortage of events from Greek history. Part of this has to do with Olympiad-based years. But while we might be unsure of exactly which year we're referring to (and with Roman chronology we similarly have to contend with dating by consular period), that fails to explain our ignorance of the exact day on which specific festivals were held. David Meadows after explaining the difficulties calculating dates from a lunar calendar and conflicting theories on Greek dates, arrives at a functional system in "This Day in Ancient History." Seasonal Festivals of the Greeks and Romans from Biblioteca Arcana dates the festivals to major solar events.

Ancient Roman events were dated by the consuls of the year, which would be accurate if we had all the consuls, and if the Roman calendar hadn't been so unreliable a timetable, subject to the not always timely interventions of the priests, until Caesar fixed it. Even then, it still needed fine tuning. 753 B.C. corresponds with the date the Romans thought Rome was founded, but even this starting point isn't reliable. One other caveat: the Roman year didn't always start in January.
