There are different ways to refer to a sequence of pages in a reference work. One is to use a Latin abbreviation for the word for 'following.' This is '' which stands for the conjunction'and' with a word like'following' after it. If you wanted to refer to a set of pages beginning on p. 123, you could writeThere is a period following the abbreviation et seq. P.123 et. seq. obviously does not tell where the reference ends. In contrast, if the reference were to pages 123-25, the reader would know exactly where the reference ends. Some stylesheets only allow the 'et seq.' abbreviation in specific places, like footnotes and citations.
