This is a five question, self-grading quiz on the period of Roman history in which the barbarians were a very real and always present danger.

You might try to guess the answers without reading any of the related articles, but it might prove difficult for you, since this quiz is more than usually connected with a specific article on this site. Specifically, it asks about passages written by two contemporary historians that I use in this article: The Barbarian at the Gates and Other Roman Difficulties at the Edges of Empire. This is the fourth in a series of articles on the Fall of the Roman Empire and the Rise of Kingdoms in Europe. The earlier ones in the series are:

 2. Who took advantage of the conflict between Constantinople and the Sassanid Persians?
