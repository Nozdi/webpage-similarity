The source for this chronological list of deified emperors of Rome is the classic work on inscriptions by Sir John Edwin Sandys -- Latin Epigraphy (1927).* Despite the exclusion of the horrible Julio-Claudians, the deification of an emperor does not mean the emperor was universally approved. Many of the deified emperors had memory of them abolished by decree of the Senate.
