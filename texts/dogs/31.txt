Question: Why should I bother going to the vet when my dog is not sick?  Answer: The annual exam is much more than just a cursory check-up. It is most often during these exams that a veterinarian can pick up the early warning signs of a serious problem that will affect the dog in the future. Serious problems can often be corrected or at least slowed in progress when they are detected early. 

There is quite a bit more to an annual exam than most people think. Without regular check-ups, some dogs will not display any symptoms, and owners will oftimes find themselves with an extremely sick dog on their hands, and sometimes it is too late to save them. Please make sure YOUR pet gets in to see a vet at least once a year, even if she always been healthy. After all, prevention is so much better than cure.
