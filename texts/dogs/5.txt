Ticks are an indisputably dreaded enemy - none of us wants to find a tick on our dogs, other pets or ourselves. Besides the obvious "ick" factor, ticks are bad news because they may transmit diseases and even cause anemia or paralysis. As a dog owner, there are some basics you should know about the risks of ticks, as well as their removal and prevention. With proper knowledge, you can help protect your dog from the threat of ticks. If you live in a region where ticks are found, you should check your dog for ticks after coming in from the outdoors, especially if he has been in a wooded area. Ticks should be safely removed and dogs watched for signs of tick borne illnesses. Dogs at risk for ticks should be treated with some form of tick prevention.
