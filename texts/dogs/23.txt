This is in no way a complete list of household toxins. Remember that any item in or around your home can pose a risk for your dog. Learn about the safety of products before you use them. Use as many pet-safe products as possible. Keep dangerous items where your dog absolutely cannot find them. Keep your dog away from areas where cleaners, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides have been recently sprayed (many are safe once dry, but find out which ones are safe and use those). If your dog is exposed to a toxin, the time to act is immediately. Do not wait for symptoms to appear. Never induce vomiting unless directed to do so by a veterinary professional. Caustic substances can be more harmful coming back up than they were going down!
