When you choose to get a dog, you must choose to become a responsible dog owner. Unfortunately, not all dog owners act responsibly, abandoning their dogs when they become inconvenient. The most irresponsible of dog owners will leave them to fend for themselves in a vacant home or chained in a yard. This is tragic and unacceptable. 
   
Health problems will happen from time to time in people and pets. If your dog has a chronic illness, it is your duty to help manage it. If current therapy is not working, ask for a referral to a specialist or get a second opinion. Tell your vets that you are at the end of your rope and you need help. 
 
With regards to behavior problems: have you heard the expression “there are no bad dogs, only misinformed owners?” This is generally true. Our dogs act the way we train them to act, so a behavior problem is YOUR responsibility. Hire a trainer or visit a behaviorist. If you cannot afford this, learn about dog training on your own. Talk to anyone who will listen – you may find someone else who has experienced the same problem.
 
This is probably the most understandable reason to give up your dog, but there may be other options. Turn to your family and friends for help. Your dog will most likely be a comfort to you during your illness, so it will be beneficial to keep him around. Some cities and towns have outreach programs where volunteers come and care for the pets of sick owners. Contact local animal rescue groups for suggestions.
 
If you are the caregiver of a dog owner who must enter a nursing home or similar facility, consider keeping the dog yourself or placing the dog with friends or family.
