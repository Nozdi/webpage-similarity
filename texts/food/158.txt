From Greece to Russia and throughout the middle east, you can find some version of this dish. It is clear people like stuffing vegetables with delicious fillings.

In Greece, these are the most popular ones you will find that is stuffed in grape leaves. You may find variations, some with and some without meat, but at the heart, it is all the same.

Making these is definitely a labor of love. It is not necessarily a hard dish, just one that takes some time to make

The time comes in adding the filling to the grape leaves and then rolling them.

My family comes from the town of Kalamata (where the olives come from!) and I would always hear stories of how my ancestors would work in the olive fields tending to them and the women would deal with the leaves and made wonderful foods, like this recipe here. So for me, this is a special dish to make. A way to connect with times long ago.

Thus, I have fond memories of making this recipe. At times, my family would all sit around a table, with a big bowl of the meat mixture in the middle and a giant pot. We all would roll our grape leaves and place them in the pot, all while discussing topical conversations and catching up.

With that  in mind, next time you want to have a family night, try making some dolmathes :)

The one aspect that brings this dish together is the Greek cuisine star known as avgolemono. The egg lemon sauce is poured over the dolmathes while in the pot and some is added over them as they are put on a plate

It will be the highlight of the dish and if you like lemon, it will soon be one of your favorite aspects.

Give this recipe a try. It has been in my family of a very long time and now I give it yours.
