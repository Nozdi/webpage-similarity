If there were a "glue" that held Greek cuisine together, it would be this. Yes, I'm talking about that rich, creamy, and tantalizing dip knows as tzatziki! A beautiful blend of fresh products such as cucumber and dill, along with a few other extra ingredients.

A lot of people get their first taste of this delicious sauce while having a gyro or maybe some souvlaki for the first time. Or you may have had a variation of it, as there are similar versions found in many countries from Bulgaria to India.

However, one thing I think people underestimate is its versatility! This dip can be used and served for so many different occasions beyond what it is traditionally paired with.

You can have it alongside vegetables, as a spread on a sandwich, with any meat or poultry, and finally, if you're like me - by itself with a spoon :) I mean, it is made with Greek yogurt, so it's healthy and packed with protein

It really is a fantastic supplement and will add a nice cool clean flavor boost to whatever you are cooking.

There are many different ways to make this, and each Greek swears by their version. This particular recipe comes from my family and now I'm sharing it with yours.

If you make it different, I would love to know! Send me an email and I'll put together another post to showcase all the wonderful variations people have for making their special tzatziki!
