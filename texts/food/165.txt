It is the one Greek dessert you can always count on at your local Greek festival. It is actually the most well known Greek dessert outside of Greece (my opinion).

What is unique about this dessert, is there are so many variations spread across Europe and parts of Asia that you could go a long time without having the same recipe twice.

The true beauty of this dessert is the sweet nut mixture wrapped in flaky phyllo and topped with honey, lemon, and vanilla flavors.

A lot of people tend to stay away from making this since you're required to work with phyllo, but that's half the fun.

The first time I made this recipe, the phyllo did not work with me. I think it had a mind of its own and was purposely trying to be difficult. Then when I got it to corporate, it turned out too soggy. I finally figured it out and make it regularly.

1. Make sure the syrup is cool before pouring over hot baklava

2. Don't be afraid of phyllo. Have everything you need out and a plan in your mind before unwrapping. You will have extra sheets, so just keep going should one break or fall apart.

3.Don't saturate the sheets in butter, this can make it soggy as well.

Overall, have fun with it. If it doesn't come out perfectly your first time, that's ok. Chances are it will still taste good :)
