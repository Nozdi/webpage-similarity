Tropical fruits like mango and papaya are a great choice in a smoothie. If you like you can spice up the basic recipe by adding almond extract or even a pinch of nutmeg or cinnamon, but I prefer keeping it simple.

Cut the stem off the papaya, cut the papaya in half lengthwise and scoop out the black seeds in the middle. Use a knife to remove the peel. Chop the papaya flesh. Prepare the mango (see how to cut and cube a mango ). Cut the peeled banana into thin slices.Spread the 1 cup chopped mango, 1 cup chopped papaya and the sliced banana out on a baking sheet. Freeze for at least 15 minutes.Combine the yogurt, frozen fruit and orange juice in a blender and process until smooth. Add lime juice and honey, blend and add more to taste if desired. Add the ice cubes if using and process.Pour the smoothie into drinking glasses and chill until ready to serve. If desired, garnish the smoothies with any leftover papaya or mango fruit.Serves 2 to 3
