Yes, that infamous appetizer (meze) that everyone associates with a Greek restaurant. A lot of people love this dish, and besides it tasting delicious, it probably has something to do with the fire spectacle.

Saganaki (saganaki) actually gets its name from the two handled frying pan it is served in, which is called a "sagani."

In Greece, it is served how we have presented it below, without the flame experience. This may actually be a good thing since you do not want to accidently burn your house down, but do not worry, we will tell you how to create the spectiabel should you have the desire to replicate the restaurant experience at home.  The extra flame kick, is said to have been created in 1968 at the Parthenon restaurant in Chicago by the way.

This meze is traditionally served with bread and can have a based in a wide variety of cheeses; however, the most common ones are: kefalotyri, kasseri, kefalograviera, graviera, and even halloumi.

We personally use kefalotyri or kasseri but have been tempted to try it using halloumi as it is a fantastic mild cheese that we thoroughly enjoy.

At the basic level, minus the fire, it is essentially a fried cheese. It can be a little salty, so do not add in any. We love it with french bread or some baked pita. Also, a little ouzo does not hurt either.

Give it a try and let us know how you like it. If you do decide to use the flame route, be careful, and you *must* yell OPA! when serving it :)
