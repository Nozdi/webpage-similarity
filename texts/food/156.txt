this is SO GOOD!... what i did to make the dip less watery was I grated one cucumber with a box grater ( that in itself took a lot of water out) and another one i cut up into little pieces. i then put the cucumbers in a dish towel over a bowl, put some salt on them and put them in the fridge covered for an hour. i then twisted the cucumber in the towel which made A LOT more water come out. I put the cucumbers in the bowl and then put the greek yogurt in the same dish towel and rang it out. A LOT of water came out with that as well. i did use lemon instead of vinegar. i put more dill and a little bit of mint. everything else i followed exactly. it is so good it is like the gods descended from the heavens!
