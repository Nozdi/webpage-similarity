French toast has long been one of my favorite breakfast choices, and I love trying new flavors and syrups. This version is really quite simple, made with the addition of pure maple syrup and a little cinnamon.

Here's what you need to make it:

In a large bowl, combine the eggs with the cream or milk, the maple syrup, vanilla, salt, and cinnamon. Whisk until well blended.  Pour the egg and milk mixture into a pie plate or wide, shallow bowl. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add enough butter to coat the bottom of the skillet. Put two slices of bread in the egg and milk mixture, turning to let it soak up as much as possible. When the butter is hot and foaming, add the bread slices to the skillet. Cook until golden brown on the bottom. Turn and brown the other side. Adjust the heat as necessary to keep the butter from burning. This will take about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the cooked French toast slices to a pan or rack and put them in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining bread and egg mixture. Serve the French toast with butter and more maple syrup.
