I am amazed to have tasted this preparation and would now prepare for others who are equally fond of beef, here at Bangalore. I used coconut oil and not the regular veg. oil. The taste is wonderful. I wish you could also send a reply mail for beef authentic Kerala gravy (thick), rather than the usual curry. SAM
