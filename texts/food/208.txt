Just as good without the alcohol!, Member karilean

I hope everyone will try this recipe just as written, because they are super-delicious - best brownie I've ever made or eaten! I've not made brownies any other way since finding the recipe - they are that good! But I just made them using 10 oz. of cola in place of the stout, and I thought they came out just as good as the original recipe. I mixed 2 packets of instant coffee granules into the Coke to enhance the chocolate (just like with the stout, you don't taste the coffee or the coke flavor.) I think I'll probably add the instant coffee again, next time I make them with stout (I use Young's Double Chocolate Stout instead of Guinness.) But you could also substitute 10 oz. of weak coffee or water (or even orange juice, to add a subtle hint of orange!) if you wanted to avoid using alcohol. Also, I substituted peanut butter chips for the white chocolate this time, but you couldn't really taste the PB. I think you could though, if the cup of chips scattered over the top at the end was PB instead of semi-sweet (but only for the non-alcohol version, not the original recipe.) And the first time I made these, I mixed the choc. chips into the batter before pouring it into the pan; I liked that way better than scattering them on top because you got bits of melty chocolate throughout the brownie instead of just on top. Lastly, be careful to *slowly* add the melted chocolate to the beaten eggs; otherwise, the heat from the chocolate will cook the eggs and you'll end up with scrambled chocolatey eggs. Anyway, try these brownies TODAY!
