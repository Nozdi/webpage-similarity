When I make this I use 2 cans of cherries to 1 can of pineapple tidbits. Crushed pineapple seems overly sweet and you can't taste a good mouthful of pineapple. Or double same if I want more filling than topping. Keeps it from being oversweet. Also I use lemon cake mix, again to cut down on the sweetness. I just cut the butter into slices and lay them in rows on top of the cake mix. I like the mixture of softer cake (without or very little butter) and the crunchier parts with more butter. I definitely cook this around an hour until the top is very crunchy and brown. First recipe to teach to kids. Couldn't be easier and always comes out delicious. Serve with whipped cream.
