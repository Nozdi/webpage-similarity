Try this simple meatloaf from Joan. It can be cooked in the slow cooker or oven, and it's a great meal with potatoes and peas or green beans. Or, serve with your favorite vegetables.

Mix well and put into the center of the pan, pulling it away from the edges by forming it into the shape of either an oblong or round loaf according to the size and shape of your pan. Shape the top of the loaf higher than the sides and make sure that you have allowed space for any grease to drain by pulling the meatloaf away from the sides of the pan, but do not shape the loaf over the top of the pan. It should not be any higher than your pan is.

Bake either in a conventional oven or a crock pot as per directions below. You can add Ketchup to the top of the meatloaf if you prefer. Leftovers are great for sandwiches too

Use a rack if you have one, if not that is okay too. Remove immediately when done so as not to soak up grease. Slow Cookers' cook at different temps, so to be safe, try this the first time only when you going to be home. I was surprised to find that my meatloaf cooked up quicker that the directions noted.

Conventional Oven: 

 Bake at 350 degrees for 50-60 minutes. Remove immediately when done so as not to soak up grease. Joan's Notes: 

 I have used this meatloaf recipe successfully for 30 years and I have never tired of it! It is the best and the easiest recipe for meatloaf that I have ever found. It is great either hot or cold. If I make one of these in the summer then I use the Crock Pot. To use this meatloaf for sandwiches, remove it immediately, wrap in foil and put in the fridge to slice only after it is well chilled.
