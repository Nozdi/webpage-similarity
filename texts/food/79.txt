Thanks to Libby for sharing this tasty everyday casserole. The chicken and rice casserole is loaded with flavor and it's easy to prepare and bake. Serve this casserole with sliced fresh tomatoes or a tossed salad for a satisfying meal.

I made some adjustments to Libby's original recipe, adding more water and increasing the baking temperature, but the combination of ingredients remains the same.
