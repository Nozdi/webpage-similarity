I'm not a good cook, but I can make these, and they taste good. 1 cup of peanuts was too much. I made them a second time with 3/4 cup, and they were better. The first time I made them, I dropped them by spoonfuls as directed, but the second time, I formed them into balls about the size of a golf ball and then smashed them flat between the palms of my hands, and that worked out better. This recipe doesn't make 3 dozen; it makes 15-18.
