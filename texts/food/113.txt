Indian food grows in popularity everyday but it is also highly misunderstood. I am constantly reminded of this as I speak to my non-Indian friends and acquaintances. Common misconceptions about Indian food have it typecast as hot, spicy, oily, diet-busting and generally unhealthy! This couldn't be further from the truth!

There is such an amazing and diverse range of healthy, wholesome and tasty foods to choose from, as my husband often says, "... if you cooked a different Indian dish every day of the year, you would still take a number of years to get to the stage where you would need to repeat one!" Now that's choice for you! Don't let other people's opinions hold you back from trying out one of the world's greatest cuisines. Explore and discover the truth about Indian food for yourself. You will never regret it!
