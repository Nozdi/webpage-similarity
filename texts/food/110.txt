I was on Facebook the other day and a dear friend had posted a picture of his breakfast and captioned it 'Breakfast of Kings'. One look at the picture and I couldn't have agreed more!

Even though my family is North Indian, as children, weekend breakfasts were often South Indian style and consisted of Dosa, Idli, Sambar and South Indian Coconut Chutney.... We loved this and eagerly waited for these breakfasts! So popular are these foods in India that I even remember a man going door-to-door selling the Idli and Dosa batter, all made and ready to cook with right away! Idli and Dosa batter takes time and pre-planning to prepare so this is not uncommon.

Breakfast like a champion this weekend... cook these yummy South Indian foods...
