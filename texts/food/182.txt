Traditional Flapjack has to be one of the quickest, easiest and importantly cheap baked goods to make. This flapjack recipe, delicious as it is, also has many variations making it evenbetter, see my notes below.



 Traditional flapjack is also healthy as it is made mainly from oats which are full of iron, zinc and vitamin B, so you can eat them without too much guilt.



 Do note however,  British Flapjack is different to flapjack in the US which is a thick pancake.

If you are not sure of the difference, then take a look at my notes on What is Flapjack?
