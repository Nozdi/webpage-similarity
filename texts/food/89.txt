I needed to ""veganize"" this recipe, so substituted Nayonnaise (soy-based mayo substitute). I doubled the pasta (used a box...1 lb.) of mostaccioli noodles, doubled the black beans, and doubled the dressing (so that more dressing can be added in subsequent days as the pasta absorbs it). It was absolutely delicious! Needs to chill at least overnight in the fridge, so that the flavors co-mingle. I have to say that it isn't as amazing when you first toss it together, before it's chilled, but the next day.....WOW!! My vegan son said, ""Make sure you don't lose this recipe."" No one else guessed it was vegan....got rave reviews from everyone!
