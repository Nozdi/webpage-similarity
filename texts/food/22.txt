Just thought I'd say that this recipe is super-simple and very tasty. I've used it twice this week (Christmas holidays) and guests love it. Another nice thing about this recipe is that it's open to interpretation; for example, if one were to mix the 5-spice with, say, galangal, the recipe would easily accommodate this. It's very important to grease the pan prior to inserting, otherwise the egg white/sugar mix will be very difficult to remove. That said, a non-stick spray isn't totally necessary - butter will do.
