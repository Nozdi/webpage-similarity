Tortelli?No. They're a stuffed pasta that's more closely related to ravioli and such,
		and are the high point of many a country fair. According to a friend who owned
		a pasta factory, they must be made by hand to come out right, because the dough
		of the sheet is too thick for machines. Its worth the effort.  Wash and peel the potatoes, quarter them, and steam them until done but
		firm (they shouldnt be mushy).  Sauté the lard and the onions in a skillet until the onions are
		lightly browned.  Mash the potatoes (a potato ricer makes mashing easier) while
		theyre still hot. Put them mashed potatoes in a bowl and add the onion
		mixture, two tablespoons of grated cheese, the eggs, and a pinch of salt and
		pepper. Mix well and let cool.  Meanwhile, make a the pasta, using 1 1/4 pounds flour and four eggs:
		make a mound of the flour on your work surface, scoop a well into it, crack the
		eggs into it, and work them into the flour, together with a pinch of salt. If
		need be, add a few drops of water as well, but go easy. Knead the dough until
		it is smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes, then roll out two sheets about the
		thickness of a nickel. The sheets should be rectangular and about the same
		size.  Place, on one of the sheets, walnut-sized balls of filling about 1 1/2
		inches apart. Carefully lay the second sheet over the first and press the dough
		down between the balls of filling with your fingers so the pasta sticks well.
		Using a serrated pasta wheel, cut the dough to make square tortelli.  Boil the tortelli in salted water, removing them with a slotted spoon as
		theyre done (a minute after they rise to the surface) to a warm serving
		bowl, pour the melted butter and the remaining grated cheese over them, and
		serve.  Hint: If you happen to have some left over drippings from a roast,
		replace half the butter with them. You can also serve tortelli with meat sauce
		or tomato sauce, and grated cheese. Serve with a fairly hearty wine, for
		example Chianti Rufina.  Send a Card!
