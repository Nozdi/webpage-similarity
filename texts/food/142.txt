India has a huge street food culture and every city, big or small, is home to street vendors churning out delicious, inexpensive food at little roadside stalls. Chaat is a popular street side food. It is not only the name of a delicious dish, but also the generic name used to refer to a group of savory, spicy, tangy, sweet street foods. Sev Batata Puri (from Maharashtra in western India) is a great example of Chaat. Like all other Chaat, if you have a few basic ingredients ready (you can make them ahead of time and store) you can throw some together in minutes! The Puris for Sev Batata Puri can be bought at any good Indian food store, but I have included the recipe here for those of you who may not have access to the mat your local store.
