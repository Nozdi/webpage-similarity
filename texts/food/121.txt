Chaat is the generic name for a whole group of much loved, tangy, sweet, spicy North Indian street foods! Palak Pakodi Ki Chaat is a unique twist on traditional Tikki Ki Chaat and combines two favorite Indian snacks - Pakodis and Chaat - into one delicious dish! The Palak Pakodis form the base and are 'garnished' with an array of toppings ranging from chickpeas and potatoes to yummy chutneys. I love to throw Chaat parties for my friends and Palak Pakodi Ki Chaat is an all-time favorite, must have dish at these get togethers. Make it for yourself and you'll see why. I must warn you though, it is so tasty, you will probably make a meal of it!
