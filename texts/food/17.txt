Carnival Pinwheels is a quilt pattern that can be sewn to suit any theme. My own choices are bright, and remind me of the spinning pinwheels we see at summer carnivals and fairs. Two blocks are used to sew the quilt. Block components can be assembled in several ways, but we'll use a combination of flying geese and half square triangle units to create the patchwork. The orange and red patches that form diamond shapes pop out as strong diagonal pathways. To make pinwheels and stars emerge, choose brighter fabrics for those spots, and then sew the pathways in more muted colors. No actual diamond shapes are used to create the quilt... form when half square triangle units are joined. Quilting Fabrics and Other Materials Blocks look different, but are actually very similar.
