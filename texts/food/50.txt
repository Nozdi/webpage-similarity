I modified it a bit, but good for any night, Member kyleplack

Excellent, delicate flavor. I substituted Cointreau since we are temporarily out of sherry and rice wine (they don't last long around here). I also added snow peas. Lastly, I always use dried mushrooms, so when I boiled the mushrooms to reconstitute them, I saved the licor (right term? - the leftover brown liquid from the mushrooms) and used it to make the chicken broth. Even with the modifications, the recipe was great and I would serve this any night of the week.
