Movies and television shows tend to show celebrants popping the champagne cork, usually with great force. However, this isthe proper way to open champagne. That forceful pop and stream lets the effervescence escape, not to mention the wine that spills out in a frothy mess. And for goodness' sake,shake the bottle!To open, untwist and remove the wire cage over the cork. Cover the cork with your hand in case it pops prematurely, although this rarely happens. Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle with the fingers of one hand grasping the cork. Gently rotate the bottle, not the cork, with your other hand. When the cork begins to loosen and lift, use your thumb to ease it gently from the bottle.It's still a good idea to have glasses nearby, even though this method should not release any foaming stream.
