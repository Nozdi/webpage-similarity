It is another lovely hot day here in the UK (at least where I am it is). What better than a glass of Pimm's Elderflower cordial or a crisp dry rose wine, perhaps the first drinks to come to mind on a lovely warm day. However, what about giving British beer a try instead? Whether you're simply throwing sausages onto a barbecue or planning a more elaborate al fresco feast, there's nothing quite like a glass of chilled, refreshing British beer alongside.Choosing beer to go with food is actually quite easy and for a general rule-of-thumb, lighter beers usually complement lighter summer foods. Don't however limit your options to lager. Although this is a fine match to many summer foods, there are other interesting combination's and experimenting can reveal some surprising winners - try a glass of chilled Guinness with white fish, for example?The British Beer and Pub Association gave me a few pointers on choosing the right beer for your food and you can read what they had to say to me.
