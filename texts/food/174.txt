My new favorite soup! This is what chicken soups should all be like! This soup was very easy to make and tastes wonderful. I did end up simmering it a bit longer than it stated to make sure the chicken was cooked completely and tender and I added all the chicken meat back in afterwards for a more filling soup. If desired, extra vegetables could be added but are not necessary. I was very happy with the flavor, and love how only fresh ingredient are used and that the broth comes from the chicken, not a can or any artificial ingredients. This should rate highly for most diets since it's just chicken meat, natural broth and vegetables - Paleo, low carb, Atkins, Weight Watchers, South Beach, Weston Price, Zone, GAPS diet, SCD diet, gluten-free, etc. It's allergen free (dairy/wheat/egg free, etc). Give it a try!
