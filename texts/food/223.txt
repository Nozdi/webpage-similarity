Fresh sage leaves should be aromatic and should have no soft spots or dry edges. Wrap in paper towels and store in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Use within 4 to 5 days.Fresh leaves may be covered in olive oil and stored in the refrigerator up to 3 weeks. Use the flavored oil for sauteeing or in salad dressings To freeze fresh sage leaves, wash and pat dry, remove leaves from the stems, and pack loosely in freezer bags. Freeze up to 1 year. Be aware that freezing will intensify the flavor of the herb and adjust accordingly.Dried sage is preferred by most cooks and comes in whole leaf, rubbed, and ground form. Rubbed sage has a light, velvety texture, whereas ground sage is more of a free-flowing powder. As with all dried herbs, store closed containers in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Use within 6 months for best flavor.
