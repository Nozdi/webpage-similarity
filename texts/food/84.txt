This delicious pasta salad is loaded with vegetables, and it has just enough mayonnaise in it to give it great flavor and creaminess. I made this with macaroni, but any similar pasta will work. Serve this at your next summer get together or take it along to a potluck dinner. It's great with burgers, or serve with grilled marinated chicken or steaks.
