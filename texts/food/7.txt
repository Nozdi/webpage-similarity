Individuals added the sauce and some chilli relish later. From MahaRating: 5 out of 5 starsComments: I usually can't cook worth anything, but this was really simple and it turned out great! Thanks! From SteveRating: 4.75 out of 5 starsComments: I loved this dish! It was easy to make and tasted great. I loved that the onions were in every bite and were sweet tasting but crunchy. It was a great way to get rid of leftovers and smelled awesome. Though it could have tasted a little bit more like Asian Cuisine, it was still awesome. From Dana
