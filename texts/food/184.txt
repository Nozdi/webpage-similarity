One of the most refreshing drinks for the summer is an Elderflower Cordial. This recipe is quick and easy to make and a great excuse for a long walk collecting flowers.



 The Elderflower season is short, late May to the latest, mid-July if you live in the the north or Scotland. The heavily scented flowers make a wonderful, refreshing drink which, when stored in sterilised bottles will keep for several weeks.



 A word of warning: if you are out collecting Elderflowers, make sure you have permission to pick them and never pick flowers from trees on roadsides as they may be tainted with petrol fumes.



 Though the cordial does make a refreshing drink, it is also useful in many different recipes too. Take a look at my favourite 8 recipes here.
