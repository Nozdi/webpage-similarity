This lovely recipe from Simon Hopkinson's book, Vegetarian Option, is a cross somewhere between a baked pumpkin and a pumpkin soup. Simon first encountered the recipe in the seminal book,and over the years has adapted it to a more manageable recipe for the home-cook.This Pumpkin Soup recipe is perfect for an autumn or winter supper, great for Halloween and for Bonfire Night it is perfect.
