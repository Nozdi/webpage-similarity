Chinese seasonings such as hoisin and oyster sauce add a different flavor to this easy barbecue sauce recipe.

Whisk together all the ingredients. Store in a sealed container in the refrigerator for at least an hour to give the ingredients a chance to blend. Quickly whisk the sauce again before using, brushing on the meat or poultry during grilling. If not using immediately, keep the sauce stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator and use within 7 days.This would work as a sauce with 4 chicken breast halves (8 to 10 ounces each) or even as a marinade for the chicken (for best results when marinating chicken, double the recipe for 4 chicken breast halves. With a knife, make a few shallow, crosswise cuts in each breast to allow the marinade to penetrate. Pour the marinade into a large resealable plastic bag, add the chicken breasts and seal, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, turning occasionally).
