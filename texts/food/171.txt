If you have ever been to Crete, chances are you may have had this dish or at the very least, seen it.

Traditionally, Dakos (ntakos) are made with rusk, a hard bread made with chickpea flour. However, you can make this with any hard bread, and that's what we did. We weren't able to find the proper rusk, and we thought most people might not have access to it at their store either.

It's okay because making it with bread enables everyone to give this recipe a try!

This Cretan appetizer is something very similar to the Italian's bruschetta, just with a Greek twist.

The acidity of the tomatoes is cut and perfectly balanced by the saltiness of the feta and pushed into deliciousness by the Kalamata olives.  While we were in Crete, we had it with wine, so that's what we recommend pairing it with.

Overall, it is a very easy recipe to make. Just make sure you have some day old bread on hand and you will be good to go.

This is always a great go to when we've had bread for dinner the night before and didn't finish it. The following day it is hard and perfect for Dakos!

The juices will soften the bread a bit, but you want it to be hard as you would with bruschetta.

If you saw this recipe and want to make it today, there is a trick:

Slice up a loaf of your favorite bread and place in oven at 120F for 2-3 hours, or until they are hard. Cooking at a low temperature of this long removes the moisture from the bread and makes it hard.

So, give these Cretan apps a try and let us know what you think!
