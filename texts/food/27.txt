Staging
 
 When cancer is found, the patient's doctor needs to know the stage, or extent, of the disease to plan the best treatment. The doctor may order various tests and exams to find out whether the cancer has spread and, if 
so, what parts of the body are affected. In some cases, 
lymph nodes near the tumor are removed and checked 
for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes, it may mean that the cancer has spread to other 
organs.
