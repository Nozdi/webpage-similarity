We've all had days when we've over-indulged with food and ended up feeling really guilty. We tell ourselves how we just HAVE to start eating healthy. Even before we've begun, we feel sorry for ourselves as we imagine our 'lean meals' as being typically dull, tasteless, steamed or boiled stuff. Anyone feeling this with me or am I alone? Come on, you know you are amongst friends and can be honest here!

Every now and then, I will get carried away by the sheer delicious-ness (is that even a word?) of the food I am eating! Every day is a new day though and fortunately with Indian food there are so many delicious and healthy choices available!

One such example is Momos (steamed wontons, pictured above). They're actually appetizers but serve them with some fiery Sikkim Tomato Achaar and a piping hot bowl of Thukpa (clear noodle soup) and they become a wholesome, very fulfilling meal. Whip some up and you'll be feeling very diet-righteous indeed!
