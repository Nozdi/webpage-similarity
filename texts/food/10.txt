Traditionally made prairie points can be constructed in a couple of ways. Each type begins as a square of fabric, and for both methods, the length of the base of a prairie point's triangle is half of its finished height. Use this formula to decide which square size will work best for the prairie points you plan to use in a quilt: This type of prairie point should be sewn to the quilt so that its decorative opening is visible when the triangle is flipped right side up.
