I love Pooris! Since I don't make them so often - they are deep fried - when I do, it feels like such a treat! I like to serve Pooris with curries - both vegetarian and non-vegetarian - because they are perfect for mopping up the delicious gravy! What's better than a Poori you ask? A Poori with a 'filling' like Palak (spinach). The Palak not only tastes good, it adds a solid nutritional punch to an already tasty food. Try my Palak Pooris...
