Given is the very basic recipe for dosa. you can make different varieties of dosa with the same batter like set dosa, paper dosa, ghee roast,masala dosa.... and so on. Set dosa is kind of thick (almost like pancake ) and so needs to be flipped, also for this not necessary to sprinkle oil/ghee/butter on top rather than on the pan to avoid sticking.If making thin dosa the griddle to be medium -high temperature and wipe the pan with towels soaked in cold water after each dosa is made to regulate the heat steady.you can make dosa thick/thin depending on your taste . but thin is crispier and better to be ate straight away from the pan itself.
