I love pistachios! They are one of the healthiest nuts in the world and they have an amazing taste. Thankfully they are also a big part of Greek cuisine.

In present times, Aegine is a major island that cultivates pistachios. The nuts that come from this region are thought to be some of the best in the world. You can also find other Greek areas growing pistachios as well, like Boeotia, Fthiotida and Thessaly. Oddly enough, Iran and the USA are the number one exporters of this nut.

Pistachios were also found in ancient Greek times dating back to around the 2 century BC, known as "pistakia" (pistakia).

I also want to make note that the pistachios found and grown in Greece are different than what you may find at your local grocery store. Their shell is almost completely white and the red-green kernel inside has a sweeter taste.

Naturally then, incorporating them into a cookie seems to be a no brainer for a Greek food site. When we created this recipe, we were trying to be a bit health conscious (using pistachios), and while they may not be the healthiest cookies in the world, I'm sure there are worse ones out there :)

We thought the salty taste would blend nicely with sweet vanilla, sugar, and a bite of lemon - it turned out to be a delicious concoction. We made them twice to get the right amount of pistachios that would cater to people who loved them and people who were indifferent to them.  When we saw our friends who don't care for pistachios go back and grab a second cookie, we knew we had a winner!

Overall, I think this is a great cookie to serve and one that people will thoroughly enjoy.  It's a perfect way to tame a sweet tooth.

I would also like to note that they kind of lean more towards a semi-biscuit texture, and not a chewy cookie. Therefore, these go great with some Greek coffee (How To Make Greek Coffee).

Jane and I hope you like them! Let us know what you think!
