Souvlaki derives from the Greek word meaning skewer. It describes the meat and sometimes vegetables that are stacked on a skewer, marinated with wonderful Greek flavors, and barbequed to perfection. This dish can be served on the skewer itself, as a main meal next to potatoes, or in a pita bread with Tzatziki on top. Whichever way you decide to prepare and serve this dish, it will never be disappointing. It is quick and easy to not only prepare, but cook as well.

Making this dish combines all that is wonderful about eating a refreshing quick dish on a summer night. Barbecuing outside when the weather is just right and a cold Greek beer is waiting for you inside is more than one can ask for. The smell of fresh cut bell peppers and red onions brings a vibrancy to the air that is mouthwatering. I'll even add tomatoes to the skewers for a warm acidic bite that is just delectable. Above that, the flavors that the meat are marinated in leave you with a bright and zesty taste in your mouth.

Speaking of the marinade, it is one of the key aspects to this dish and one the really brings out the flavors. I have found that 30 minutes and a few ingredients is all that is needed to produce optimal flavor. You do not want to get too carried away and throw in too many herbs as it will overpower the the chicken and take elements away from the dish.  Once you get it just right, you will find that you no longer need to measure ingredients out rather you will just know what works and what doesn't. Over time you will also begin to figure out which proteins work best with the marinade.

No matter what you decide, you will be glad you took the time to make this classic Greek dish a part of your evening meal.
