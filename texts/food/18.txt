The tart and sweet taste of mango works well in smoothie recipes. As always, how much seasoning to add comes down to individual taste - feel free to vary the amount of honey and/or lime juice as desired. Also, orange juice generally has a sweeter taste than mango juice, so if you're just using orange juice you may want to adjust accordingly. (The same goes if you're replacing the plain yogurt with a vanilla yogurt).



 

 Add the banana, mango and yogurt and process. Add the fruit juice and process again.

 

 Add the honey, lime juice and ice cubes (If you like, add the honey and lime juice 1 teaspoon at a time, blend and then add more as desired).

 Pour into drinking glasses and serve immediately or chill until ready to serve. Feel free to garnish with leftover mango fruit.
