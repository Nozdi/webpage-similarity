This easy bok choy recipe is a perfect for busy weeknights. The trick is have all the ingredients on hand, and to stir-fry quickly so that the garlic doesn't burn (adding the water or chicken broth helps also).

Heat wok and add oil. When oil is ready, add garlic and chili paste, chili powder or red pepper flakes if using and stir-fry briefly, for about 30 seconds, until the garlic is aromatic. Add the bok choy, adding the stalks first, and then the leaves. Stir in the soy sauce, sugar, and salt, and stir-fry on high heat for 1 minute.Add the water or chicken broth, cover the wok and simmer for about 2 - 3 minutes, until the leaves are dark green and the stalks are tender but not too soft.Remove the wok from the heat. Stir in the sesame oil and season with pepper to taste. Serves 3 - 4(deep-fried bok choy appetizer)
