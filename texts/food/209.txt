Beer, ginger, garlic, olive oil, and orange peel are combined in a flavorful marinade for beef. Goes particularly well with flank steak.

In a nonreactive bowl, combine the beer garlic , and orange peel. Use a receptacle large enough to snugly hold the meat ( beef lamb , or game ) but not too large or flavor will not penetrate. Cover tightly and be sure to leave the meat in the marinade long enough to pick up the flavors of the liquid, at least 6 hours and up to 48. Turn frequently so that the marinade is evenly distributed. Strain and use as a basting sauce if desired.Yield: About 2 cupsSource: The New Settlement Cookbook edited by Charles Pierce (Simon & Schuster)Reprinted with permission.
