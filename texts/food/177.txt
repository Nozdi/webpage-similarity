One of the biggest trends in British and Irish foods is to eat seasonal foods. Eating seasonal foods is healthier as the food is fresher. It is also more environmentally friendly as the foods are often local and not been flown in from other countries. Early Spring sees food start to lighten after the comfort foods of winter, but not too much. The weather in Britain and Ireland is still inclement one day spring sunshine, the next day snow. So don't forget the stews and casseroles just yet.

Make the most of seasonal foods with nourishing soups and hearty side dishes. Soups are not only easy to make, they are usually quite cheap and nutritious with the addition of beans, pulses or grains.

As winter dishes are more often long-slow cooked foods, early spring sees things start to lighten a little. It is not yet time to forget cheaper cuts of meat that require longer cooking, or seasonal meats or British and Irish winter vegetables but there are early spring foods making an appearance in the shops, and on our tables.

There's a big difference between puddings and desserts; desserts speak of light and frivolous confections and associated with summer, but puddings are warm and comforting, solid and approachable and still an essential of the early spring menu food. 



 Puddings have been the backbone of British food for centuries, even the French extol their virtues - sacre bleu. The lightest of puddings may have the diet police screaming arrest, but if the meal is balanced - a light starter, and not too many carbs with main course - there's always room for a delicious pud.
