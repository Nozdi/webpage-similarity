I love Shakkarpara! It is a terrific tea time (or any other time) snack. Shakkarpara is most commonly made in India around festival time - especially Diwali or Christmas. Known as Shakkarpara or Shakkarpare in the North of the country, it is also called Shankarpali in Western India. Well made Shakkarpara is crisp and crunchy but not hard and not overly sweet. You can make Shakkarpara well ahead of time (2-3 weeks) and store it in a cool, dry place, in an airtight container. It is so tasty though, I can't guarantee you or your family will let it last that long! It never does in our home! Here is a simple, easy to follow recipe for Shakkarpara. It will make a nice batch of Shakkarpara for 4-6 people to snack on.
