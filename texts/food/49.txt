Definition: This amber colored, aromatic oil, made from pressed and toasted sesame seeds, is a popular ingredient in Chinese cooking. Not for use as a cooking oil, however, as the flavor is too intense and it burns quite easily. Instead, sesame oil is normally added as a flavoring agent in the final stages of cooking. (The nonroasted sesame oil you sometimes find in supermarkets and health food stores is not a good substitute for the sesame oil used in Asian cooking).

 

 Sesame oil will keep for several months if stored in a cool, dark, and dry place. Recommended Brand: Kadoya sesame oil from Japan.
