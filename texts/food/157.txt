Arguably, this is one of the top dishes known widely outside of Greece. It's also one of the most iconic dishes served at all taverna's and Greek restaurants world wide.

Let me first give thanks to legendary Greek chef, Nikolaos Tselementes (Nikolaos Tselementes), who is credited with propelling this delightful dish to the forefront of Greek cuisine.

Moussaka (mousakas) is a casserole style dish, resembling that of pastitsio. It's eggplant layered with a perfectly flavored meat mixture, and topped with the iconic bechamel sauce.

Now if you are not a fan of eggplant, this may be the dish you give a try - just to make sure you really are not a fan :)

I know many people that are not big eggplant people, but like moussaka. The combinations of flavors work so well that the eggplant is not too overpowering.

Many countries have made their own versions. I know in places like Croatia and Macedonia, they sub out eggplant and use sliced potatoes (a version you can find in Greece as well).

Another thing I love about this dish is the uniqueness it brings to Greek food. What I mean by that is it is hard to find two places making it the say way (just like tzatziki).The main alterations occur with the spices that are mixed with the meat. Some people add a little of allspice and others substitute red wine for another liquid or use nothing at all.

Both Jane and I have made it a few different ways, but below is the one that we come back to again and again and is thus are go-to method.

Remember, if anything, use this as a base and experiment with your own flavor/spice combinations. Let us know if you come up with something amazing!!
