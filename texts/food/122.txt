I'm making this now...how to grate the coconut?, Member JennyOndioline

Hey I'm making this recipe right now and I'm gonna make Sambar for dinner. One question: does anyone know how to grate the coconut? I have a dried coconut from my Indian food store and I""m not sure how to grate it. The brown outer layer seems to be getting into the gratings and I'm not sure it's supposed to do that. Any tips?
