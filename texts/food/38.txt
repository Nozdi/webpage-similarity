Soft and creamy silken tofu is the tofu of choice for smoothies and shakes. If it isn't available, you can substitute 2/3 cup of plain, low-fat yogurt. Feel free to boost the protein content of your smoothie by adding 1 or 2 teaspoons of wheat germ.

Drain the silken tofu to remove excess water (silken tofu has a high water content).

 Peel and slice the banana. Place on a baking sheet and freeze for about 15 minutes (this helps make the smoothie thicker).

 Blend the banana, tofu and soy milk for 30 seconds. Add 1/2 cup of the frozen blueberries and process until smooth. Add the remaining blueberries, honey and ice cubes if using and process again until smooth. Enjoy!
