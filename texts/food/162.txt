The Italians have lasagna. The Greeks have Pastitsio.

A dish that is very close to the heart of us Greeks. The taste is superb, and it's a go-to for large family gatherings. With that said however, it's also a perfect dish for couples to cook - or even the kids to help out as it takes a bit of love to prepare.

The word itself is derived from latin and translates to "a tough situation." I wouldn't go as far to say that you'd be in a tough situation if you made this dish, but I will say that if it's your first time making it, expect to be fully engaged with excitement and focus as you recreate the recipe.

I personally think that is the best part about making pastitsio and wholeheartedly think that's where all the love naturally comes from to give it a taste worthy of the gods.

The best part of pastitsio, besides the rich tomato base meat mixture, is the topping - yes the bechamel sauce. It's creamy. It's think. It's bliss.

It still amazes me that a few simple ingredients produce something to delectable. It really is the prime example of Greek cuisine. Simple ingredients creating amazing dishes.
