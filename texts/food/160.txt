Keftedes (kephtedes) may be one of the best Greek appetizers (meze) around! They are little round meatballs served with sauces like tzatziki and not what you might be use to seeing with meatballs - pasta.

There are many recipes for this dish and I personally love them all. Each time I travel to Greece, I always get these at the different tavernas. Each chef stands behind their version, and I've got into a few conversations with owners/fellow patrons about the tastes and or their recommendations.

One of the things that really stand out to me while having this is since it is literally meat and spices, you really get to taste all the ingredients used.

For me, I love oregano and garlic together - so this recipe highlights that. It is the play of herbs perfectly balanced with the strong presence of the garlic and onions that I think works so nicely.

There have been times where I've added lemon juice and even feta. I would recommend using this as a solid base, and add in a few other ingredients you love or think would taste good. IF left unaltered, it will still be delicious, but I always encourage people to alter and improve and cook to their preferences.

So give these a try and let me know what you think!

Have a good version? Let us know about it! Because, who doesn't love some good keftedes?
