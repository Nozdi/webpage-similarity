"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food." - Hippocrates

Kenton Kotsiris is a lover of Greek food and on a quest to explore all that Greek cuisine has to offer. What started as a way to reconnect with his heritage has turned into a lifelong passion.

With the help of Jane, the photographer/co-cooker, they are the Greekfood.about.com writers! When they aren't working here on About.com, you can find them on their blog, Lemon & Olives, a site covering Greek recipes, culture, travel, and Greek inspired dishes.

Kenton grew up cooking family recipes brought from the shores of Greece. He was trained by some of the best Greek cooks in the world - his family! Since he was young, Kenton was always in the kitchen working alongside his yiayia and papou (grandma and grandpa).

As he grew older, he realized the joy and love it brought him to cook Greek food, so he started collecting family recipes, books, speaking with restaurant owners while in Greece, and reaching out to anyone who could help him better understand the culture of cooking Greece's food.

Once he established a base, Jane urged him to start a blog so they could start sharing their recipes. They began cooking their way through Greece, and soon began creating their own Greek recipes.

They taught themselves flavor combinations, introduced themselves to spices, and anything else they thought could help - a journey they still continues to this day.

Their passion has fueled their desire to continue learning, create Greek recipes, and promote the tasty foods of Greece!

Kenton graduated from UCLA with a B.A. and The University of Sheffield with an M.A.
