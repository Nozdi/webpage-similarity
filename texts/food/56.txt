Not sure when your favorite tropical fruit will be arriving at the local grocery or Asian market? These tables provide a guide to when various Asian fruit is in season.  



Note: The availability of these fruits will vary.  While mango season begins early in the Philippines and Thailand - in March and April respectively - they normally do not start arriving in North America until May. In some areas of North America, certain types of tropical fruit can be grown locally and are available year-round. Both mangoes and litchis, for example, flourish in the hot Florida climate.



 (Besides Australia itself, the primary market for Australian-grown tropical fruit is China and Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand - they import Australian tropical fruit in the off-season).
