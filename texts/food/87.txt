This is a classic baked macaroni and cheese recipe, an excellent choice for any meal or occasion. To brown the bread crumbs a little more, turn the broiler on for a minute or two just before taking the casserole out of the oven. Watch carefully, though, for signs the topping is getting too dark.

I used whole wheat macaroni in this version, but regular macaroni, mini penne pasta, ditalini, or other similar pasta shapes would also work well.
