We had planned a special St Davids Day dinner in Christchurch NZ. The event was initially cancelled as the earthquake on 22 Feb had made my house unlivable and lots of ingredients were unavailable Friends came to the rescue and this soup was the highlight of the meal Very delicious- rich, tasty and satisfying. We serve it with crusty bread
