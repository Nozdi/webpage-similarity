Easiest and best one I have found., Member Mary01234

I looked at several idli recipes to make them homemade. After looking at several, I decided to use this one. A few of them differed slightly in ingredients, and in the method used. I chose this one because it called for the least, and necessary ingredients without any spices being enhanced, and the directions were very easy to follow. The idli's I made came out perfect when steamed. I would definitely use this recipe again. I also found it very easy to freeze the extra batter once made in an airtight container, and took some out a day or so in advance and used it as I needed it without compromising taste or texture when cooked. Perfect each time!
