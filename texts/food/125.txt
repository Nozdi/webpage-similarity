Question: Do I need many ingredients to get started cooking Indian food?

Answer: If youre just starting out with Indian cooking, the vast number of spices available in stores may actually end up confusing you. While Indian cooking does use a greater variety of ingredients than most other cuisines, there are some that are basic to most dishes. Start with these and buy in small quantities (spices lose their strength and aroma if kept for too long). Build your store and add the more exotic ingredients as you grow familiar with Indian cuisine.
