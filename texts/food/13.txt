Chinese rice vinegar and fresh ginger liven up the marinade for this ginger chicken that tastes fantastic whether grilled or broiled. This recipe is designed to make more marinade than needed - which can then be used as a dressing for a green salad to serve with the chicken, or simply saved to use for another time. (Note: the extra marinade does not come into contact with the chicken) .

 Ginger chicken tastes delicious when thinly sliced and served with peanut sauce for dipping.
