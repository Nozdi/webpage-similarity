Add all the powders and the hot tea into the blender. Add all the remaining ingredients except for the tapioca pearls or jelly toppings into the blender. Blend the ingredients to your preference.

 

 Pour the shaken ingredients over the tapioca pearls or jelly toppings into the drinking cup.

 

 Add extra chopped fresh fruit or whipped cream as a topping if desired. Use a fat straw to enjoy the smooth texture of the fresh fruit smoothie.

 

 Tips: Choose a bubble tea flavored powder that complements the fresh fruit you are using. Kiwi fruit does not work well in this recipe.
