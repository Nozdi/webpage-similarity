This soup is one of my all-time favorites. I'm a lemon lover, so what is there not to love about a soup made with lemons?

Truth be told, when the other kids were getting chicken noodle soup when it was cold outside or they were sick, I was getting this.

It is a creamy soup made with just a few ingredients, but whenever I make it, people can not seem to get enough.

If you are new to Greek cuisine, you will soon learn that avgolemono (abgolemono), an egg-lemon sauce, is a popular base for many dishes. From soups to toppings for meats and fish - it's a big part of Greek food.

Making it can be a little tricky (just make sure you temper the eggs with hot liquid before adding it to your dish), but once you get it down, you will love it. You can even thicken it up a bit and put it over veggies. I use it for a plethora of recipes, some I make up and others more traditional.

Either way, if you like lemon, this may become one of your go- to recipes.

Moreover, this recipe is simple and easy to make in large amounts, which makes it great for large family gatherings, lunch for a few days, or to share with friends.

So, give it a try and let us know what you think!

We have had it with and without chicken. Both Jane and I agree that including chicken makes all the different.

A side note: using lemon concentrate will alter the flavor. If possible, use fresh lemons.
