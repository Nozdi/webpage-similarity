They cook for you day in and day out and now it's time to return the favor! Show your Mom how much you love her and appreciate everything she has always done for you. Take over the kitchen this Mother's Day, and cook her a meal she will remember the rest of the year!

Choose Indian cuisine this year. The exotic fragrances, flavors and textures are sure to delight Mom. She will no doubt assume (and her heart will melt), that you spent hours laboring over the meal for her. That you did not actually do that, can be our little secret! No matter how inexperienced or young you may be, there's something here that you can cook.

For Breakfast: Choose one of these simple yet substantial dishes.

Aaloo Paratha (potato paratha): A hot favourite with North Indians, these are best eaten with chilled yogurt and your favorite pickle or chutney. Want to be naughty? Aaloo Parathas taste delicious with fresh, thick cream or a knob of unsalted, home-made butter!

Upma: Originally from South India, this tasty dish can be eaten for breakfast, brunch or as a snack and is so wholesome you can even make a meal of it!

Poha: From western India, Poha, made from flattened rice, is an easy-to-cook, nutritious snack. It is often eaten for breakfast or brunch. Add extra zing to Poha by serving it with Mint-Coriander Chutney!

Pyaaz-Tamaatar Ka Omelette: Serve this omlette with an Indian twist, for breakfast. Combine it with hot, flaky Parathas.

For a Hearty Brunch: Food to keep you going great until dinner...

Dhokla (steamed gram flour snack) : Serve this nutritious snack from Gujarat with Tamarind and Mint-Coriander Chutneys.

Idli (steamed rice cakes) with Sambar and Coconut Chutney: No longer just a South Indian favorite, Idlis with Sambar and Chutney are loved and can be found just about anywhere in India. Try them and you'll see why.

Spicy Veggie Cutlets: You can make these just as easily from scratch as with any leftover veggie dish. They're also a great snack!
