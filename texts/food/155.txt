Hello Greek Food Enthusiast! My name is Kenton and I'm the new Greek food writer here on About.com This section has been dormant for a few years, but now it's back! Soon, we'll be diving into the realm of Greek cuisine. I'll be sharing new and exciting Greek recipes; showing you traditional dishes as well as new and modern recipes. The foods of Greece have been know to be some of the healthiest around - they are a big part of one of the healthiest diets, the Mediterranean Diet. I hope you are as excited as I am. In the mean time, feel free to browse the site and see recipes currently listed on here from past writers.
