Bread and Butter Pudding is one of the easiest puddings to make, take a look at this recipe and you'll see why. One of the best things about this pudding is it is a great way to use up left over white bread. This same recipe will also make a Panetonne bread pudding, or ring more changes with croissants or brown bread. In fact, any type of bread can be adapted depending on your taste, except maybe the heavy dark breads.



 The method is the same whichever you use.

If you want to be really decadent, then smear the buttered bread with a little marmalade o your favourite  jam. Delicious.
