Sweet Kiwi fruit pairs nicely with nutty flavored tahini in this fruit smoothie recipe. As always, how much sweetener to add comes down to individual taste - feel free to vary the amount of honey as desired.

Wash the kiwi fruit, cut off the stem and remove the peel (the easiest way to remove the peel is to insert a small spoon between the skin and flesh and go around the kiwi, loosening the peel. Here are instructions with pictures showing how to peel kiwi . Cut the kiwi into quarters and spread out with the banana slices on a baking sheet and freeze for at least 15 minutes.Process the yogurt and frozen fruit in a blender until smooth. Add the honey and vanilla extract and process again. Add the ice cubes if using and process. Serve immediately or chill until ready to serve.Serves 2 to 3*Chinese sesame paste will give the smoothie a darker color than if tahini is used, and a stronger flavor but with a bitter aftertaste.
