When my mom makes this recipe, she uses green and white asparagus and black and white sesame seeds. It makes a gorgeous presentation. I changed it up a bit by adding sliced water chestnuts and toasted white sesame seeds. One other thing this resipe should mention is to paper towel dry the asparagus after blanching but before adding the sauce. It will keep the sauce from watering down and let it coat the veggies better.
