Tender chicken thighs lend flavor to this stir-fry made with pungent fermented black beans. You can prepare the vegetables while the chicken is marinating, or earlier in the day so that they are ready to use in the stir-fry. This recipe serves 3 to 4.

1. Combine the chicken thighs with the marinade ingredients, adding the cornstarch last. Marinate the chicken in the refrigerator for 15 - 20 minutes.2. While the chicken is marinating, if you have not already done so, cut up the vegetables (the onion, green bell pepper and carrot) and aromatics (the ginger, garlic and spring onion). In a small bowl, combine the cornstarch with the water to make a "slurry." Set aside.3. Using a 14-inch flat bottom wok, heat the wok and add 2 tablespoons oil. When the oil is hot, add half of the chopped black beans, spring onion, ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for a few seconds until aromatic. Add the chicken thighs (remove the chicken from the marinade with a slotted spoon. Discard any excess marinade). Stir-fry for 4 - 5 minutes, until the chicken changes color and is nearly cooked through.4. Push the chicken to the sides of the wok and add the remaining black bean/spring onion/ginger/garlic mixture in the middle. Add the carrot. Stir-fry for 1 -2 minutes, then add 1/4 cup chicken broth. Cover and let cook for another 2 minutes.5. Add the onion and green pepper and the remaining 1/4 cup broth. Cover and cook for 2 - 3 minutes, until the onion starts to soften. Stir in the sugar. Give the cornstarch/water mixture a quick re-stir and add into the wok, stirring quickly to thicken. Serve immediately with cooked rice.More Black Bean Sauce Recipes:- a quick and easy dish using black bean sauce- with fermented black beans- with prepared black bean sauce- from chef Martin Yan
