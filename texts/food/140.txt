Try this with this yummy samosas, Member NandiniJain

I tried this recipe and the samosas were really yummy and top notch. If tamarind chutney seems too much of a hassle to make at home, and if you are planning to serve this samosas to kids, then probably a tomato sauce would also be perfect. Like I usually have SIL Hotmato sauce. Go for this sauce if you prefer your sauce to be less sweet and little teekha (spicy ).
