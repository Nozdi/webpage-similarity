Hello everyone! This weekend is a special one! One thing that really stands out, especially coming from a Greek/Irish household, is that this year Easter is on the same day! So all the half Greeks or Greeks married to non-Greeks can celebrate this day in harmony. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to spend time with loved ones, eat good food, and just relax. I sent the following out in the Greek Food newsletter (you should sign up if you haven't!) but I wanted to share them here. Below are some Greek words you can tell you Greek friends on or around Easter! Up until Easter, we say: "Kalo Pasha" which means, "Happy Easter" On the day of Easter and a few days after, we say: "Christos Anesti" which means, "Christ has risen." If someone says the above to you, you respond with: "Alithos Anesti" which means, "He truly has risen!" Also, there are a few key things we make, which are listed below. Both Jane and I hope you have a happy Easter!! PS. I wasn't able to add the Greek spelling since it didn't recognize the typeface. *I semi-sweet braided bread.
