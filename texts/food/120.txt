Pickles and chutneys in India range from spicy to sweet and soft to crispy. They're the perfect partner for a well made meal and a 'perker-upper' for a not so perfect one!

Gajar Ka Achaar - Carrot Pickle

Pickled crunchy carrots make a terrific accompaniment for just about any meal. I love to eat this Achaar (pickle) with plain rice and yogurt!

Tamarind Chutney - Imli Ki Chutney

This tangy chutney can be used as a dip or stir-in sauce for numerous Indian snacks.
