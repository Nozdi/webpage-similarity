After pursuing fundraising for the American Red Cross, taking a humanitarian journey by herself to Guatemala, and studying abroad in the UK, Xanthe decided that she would like to dedicate her career to helping others in need, spreading cultural awareness, and sharing information through writing about the beautiful places around the world.  

Xanthe jumped straight into a senior-level class, “geography of developing nations,” to decide whether that path seemed promising for her. After learning about many nations, cultures, modes of thinking, and controversial issues, her plans with geography were cemented.  

Xanthe declared her major as English and her minor as geography, with plans to study geography in graduate school, in order to establish a strong writing background. Her plans for graduate school include incorporating studies in GIS, disaster relief, and environmental studies.
