...but do you know how to use it? There are some unusual ideas out there that do kind of make sense, if you step back and think about it -- but in actual practice they're pretty much the opposite of what you should be doing. So, just to be clear:

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has an excellent demonstration video that shows what you SHOULD do. Go to the ADF&G website and scroll down most of the way to the bottom, where you'll find the video "Bear Spray Demonstration for Hunters." (It applies to hikers, too.)

Just like anything, having the right tool (in this case, bear spray) helps a lot -- but it's only as good as how you use it. Oh, and you'd better be carrying it the right way, too. So your brain really is the ultimate survival tool, after all.
