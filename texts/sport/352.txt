I looked in my swim bag and realized that I had several types of hand paddles from the same company, Finis. Among other paddles in my bag, I have Finis' Agility, Freestyler, and Forearm Fulcrum models. Why do I have different kinds, and what are the different kinds of Finis hand paddles used for in a swim workout?
