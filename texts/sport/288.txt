Like Mikulak, Jake Dalton was primarily considered an event specialist in London, and he is superb on both floor and vault. In 2013 he earned the silver on floor at worlds ahead of four-time world all-around champ Kohei Uchimura. He also picked up two all-around victories, at the American Cup and at the Winter Cup, proving he can hold his own in the all-around as well.
