Elizabeth Price was an alternate to the 2012 Olympic team, won the 2014 American Cup and Pacific Rim titles, and is one of the best vaulters in the world. Though Price announced in April of 2014 that she was retiring from elite gymnastics, she is a gymnast to watch in the future as an NCAA star for Stanford University.

Olympic vault silver medalist McKayla Maroney has the best Amanar in the world on the women's side, but Elizabeth Price is a close second. Price scored a massive 16.05 on her vault on the first night of the 2012 Olympic Trials, one of only three scores above 16.00 during the competition (Maroney had the other two, with a 16.10 and a 16.15 for her vaults during the two-day meet).

Price isn't just a vaulter, though. She can compete well on all four events, and even placed fourth all-around at the 2012 Olympic Trials. Perhaps more impressive,she won both the 2014 American Cup and Pacific Rim Championships, as well as three World Cup all-around titles in 2012 and 2013.

Price is both a powerful tumbler and vaulter, and a dynamic bar-worker as well. On floor, she mounts with a sky-high tucked double twisting-double back (at :21) and comes back with an immediate double layout (at :24) as her second pass.

On bars, she throws a difficult toe-on piked reverse hecht (at :32) release move (called a Church), and a full-twisting double layout dismount.

Beam is considered to be Price's weakest event, but she still has a jam-packed routine. She does a standing back full at (at :13) and a round-off double pike dismount.

Elizabeth Price was born on May 28, 1996 to David and Diane Price. She has two younger brothers, Ethan and Elijah, and calls Coopersburg, Pa. as her hometown.

Price goes by the nickname Ebee, and told USA Gymnastics that she started the sport in 1999 because her "mom wanted to tire [her] out."

As an elite, Price trained nearly 40 hours a week at Parkettes National Gymnastics Center, and was coached by Bill and Donna Strauss, Robin Netwall, and John Holman. She will attend Stanford University in the fall of 2014.

Price's favorite events in gymnastics are bars and floor. She likes to read Neal Schusterman books, listen to Nicki Minaj and Justin Bieber, and watch Pretty Little Liars.
