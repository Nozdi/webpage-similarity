You know that line from Spiderman about how "with great power comes great responsibility"? Well, that counts triple when you're wearing a headlamp. That light strapped to your head has the power to help you find your way home in the dark and otherwise keep functioning long after the sun has gone down -- but it can also get you dirty looks from other hikers if you're not careful about how you use your lumen-induced power.

With that in mind, there's really only one hard and fast rule of headlamp etiquette: Beam unto others as you'd have them beam unto you.

A side note about night hiking: If you're in an area where you could reasonably encounter fast-moving non-hikers (think people on bikes, skis, snowmachines, four-wheelers or even runners), keep that headlamp on so they can see you and avoid running you over.

Also: If you're camping, using a small headlamp is a great way to read or do menial tasks without disturbing your tentmate or neighbors. But be aware that a strong headlamp inside a tent turns said tent into an illuminated fishbowl -- so if you're doing anything that you don't want the whole world to see as a shadow-puppet play on your tent wall, turn that sucker down.

Pretty common sense, right? As long as we're on the topic, here's a look at the best headlamps for hikers.
