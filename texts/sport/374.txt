This swim workout is aimed at getting in some distance. The main set in this swim practice is 4,000 meters or yards long, and the whole workout could take 90 minutes to two hours or more. If you are going to swim this workout, be sure you have worked up to it.

Swimmers, if you have done regular workouts of 3,0000 to 3,500 for several weeks, then you are certainly ready for this longer workout. Even if if yo have not, as long as you have been doing regular workouts, you may be able to knock this one out. It will be a challenge, but it may be one you want to overcome. If it is too long, stop when it is time to stop, get back in your regular routine for the next workout, and put this swim practice in the vault to take out and look at doing in the future.

This workout is designed to take between 75-minutes and 90-minutes. If that is too much time or distance, then cut things out, but do not always cut out the same thing every workout. And never skip the loosen at the end of the workout. Use that as one last bit of technique work before you leave the swimming pool at the end of the workout.

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat five more times.

There is nothing special about these swim practice sessions other than what you bring to them. Lots of freedom here. You control how hard or fast you swim and what swim strokes you want to use while swimming the workouts. Normally the amount of rest per swim will limit your top-end speed on a workout, but that does not mean go as fast as you can all of the time. A few guidelines:
