Three-time world champion and 2012 Olympic champion Kohei Uchimura did it again in Antwerp, Belgium at the 2013 World Championships, winning his fourth title by a comfortable margin of nearly 2.00 over Japanese teammate Ryohei Kato. Uchimura has now won four world titles in a row, the most of any male gymnast ever. Though it's up for debate, Uchimura may now have passed Vitaly Scherbo in the minds of many for the unofficial title of best gymnast of all time.

American Sam Mikulak was second in the qualifying round but fell to sixth on the last event, high bar. German Fabian Hambuechen overcame a fall on pommel horse and rose to the bronze medal spot after a dazzling high bar set that scored a 15.933, the highest mark of the day on any event.
