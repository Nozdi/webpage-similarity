For cleaning your bike, first either move outside or find a place such as a garage or basement where it won't be the end of the world if you drip on the floor.

You'll need the following items:

Locate where you're going to work, and spread out newspapers on the floor below your bike. A spot where you can lean your bike against something to keep your hands free while you're busy is ideal. Shift the gears on your bike while while turning the pedals so that the chain is on the largest ring in the front and on the smallest socket in the back.
