Getting serious about fitness means paying attention to your diet. Whether that means just trying to lose a few pounds or becoming more sophisticated in dialing in the right mix of carbs, fat and protein to satisfy your appetite and support your training, ultimately you need to monitor more closely what goes in your body.

Enter Racing Weight Cookbook - Lean Light Recipes for Athletes, by Matt Fitzgerald and Georgie Fear. It offers a variety of healthy recipes intended to be a fit for all levels of comfort in the kitchen: those who hate cooking and/or have never spent any time with a spatula in hand; a mid-level collection of recipes aimed at those who have basic cooking skills and can tolerate time in the kitchen; and a third level of recipes for those athletes who love to cook and are fully comfortable in the kitchen.
