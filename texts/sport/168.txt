Stand Deep in the Court and Start the Drill with a Toss Onto the Side Wall

To begin the drill, stand well behind the service box near the back wall. Begin by tossing the ball onto the side wall around head height, opposite your front foot. Let the ball bounce while you get your racquet up and back.
