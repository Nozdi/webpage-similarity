Imagine you have been playing several games and are tied two games all against an opponent with whom you are evenly matched. You have been hitting all your good shots, and your opponent has managed to stay even with you, so you are now starting the deciding fifth game. How do you win?First off, think about the patterns of shots you have been using throughout the first four games. When your opponent hits the ball to one place on the squash court, you probably get to the ball and typically hit it pretty much the same way each time. Your opponent is just the same. He or she hits in certain patterns. After four games, you should be able to discern your opponent's hitting patterns and almost anticipate where he/she will hit the ball before it goes there. To win, you must vary the pattern., because that's the easiest way to score a quick point. It's also wise to vary the pattern on your serve because you control that shot entirely; its pace, its direction, its timing. You begin the service toss when and where you want, so you are in control. After four long games, your usual serving pattern will be deeply etched in your opponent's conscious or subconscious mind, and it will be hard for your opponent to suddently receive an entirely different serve.So, prepare to serve just as you normally do, and do not give any indication that your serve will be entirely different from all the other serves you have hit so far in the match. Then, hit one of these three change-up serves to win a quick point:You'll be amazed how easy it is to win a point when you vary your serve. If you don't win the point immediately, you'll surely be able to win the point by taking advantage of your opponent's weak serve return.and enjoy your ability to get a quick point when you need it.
