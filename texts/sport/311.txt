When the dust settles on Atletico Madrid's amazing La Liga triumph, it will be recognized as one of the greatest of the last 50 years. This is a club who, in winning their first Liga title since 1996, broke Spanish soccer's traditional hegemony, at a time they had no right to do so. Coach Diego Simeone does not have a Lionel Messi at his disposal, nor the world's most expensive player Cristiano Ronaldo, nor last summer's most expensive purchase Gareth bale.

Chelsea's 2-0 win over Liverpool on Sunday was a real kick in the teeth for soccer's romantics. The Reds' destiny - and the prospect of a first title in 24 years - was in their own hands until Steven Gerrard's cruel slip enabled Demba Ba to run clear and put Jose Mourinho's side 1-0 up before the break. Willian rubbed salt into Liverpool wounds late on.

At the grand old age of 41, Mark Schwarzer could have a big say on the destination of this season's Champions League. Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper Petr Cech was ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering a shoulder injury in the 0-0 draw with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. Schwarzer replaced the Czech at the Vicente Calderon and proved a safe pair of hands as Chelsea eased to a draw in Spain.

In one of the most enthralling games of the Premier League season, Liverpool took the box seat in the title race with a 3-2 win over Manchester City. On a day when Anfield remembered the 96 people who perished in the Hillsborough disaster 25 years ago, Liverpool took a 2-0 half-time lead through Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel.
