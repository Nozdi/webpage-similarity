Car break-ins at trailheads are a common problem. After all, most trailheads are fairly remote -- and crooks can be confident that the average hiker is leaving his or her vehicle unattended for a decent stretch of time.

The good news is that if there's nothing in your car worth taking, said thieves usually won't bother -- so if you're going to leave any valuables in your car, always hide them out of sight. Do it before you get to the trailhead, though; some thieves hang out in the bushes and watch who hides what where.

I usually subscribe to the theory that the more people around, the less likely it is that my car will be broken into -- so if I have the choice of several trailheads, I'll opt for the more heavily traveled of the lot. You can also protect your car by parking it in the most visible location available, or as close as possible to any caretaker/host shacks.

And finally, there are a few basic car skills you should have any time you leave the city limits -- check out the list.
