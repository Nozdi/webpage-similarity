'Saint Iker,' as he is known at Real Madrid, was dropped for much of the 2012-13 season by Jose Mourinho, but remains a club legend, having come through the youth system. Casillas has often had the misfortune of having an inadequate defense in front of him as Real have focused on assembling a fearsome attack, only to neglect the backline. But this simply meant he was able to showcase his skills to an even greater extent, bailing out his defense time and time again, putting his body on the line and making spectacular saves when the opposition looked odds-on to score. One of a kind.
