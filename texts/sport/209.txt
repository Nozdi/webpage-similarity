In squash, there is a place near the center of the court where two red lines meet on the floor, forming the letter 'T'. This place is the "power zone" which you should control at all costs. You should never give up this spot to your opponent for very long. 



 Here's how to play a fun "power zone" game with your partner, and improve your court positioning and movement back to the T:

 1. Put a piece of colored tape on the floor of the court, going across the center of the court and connecting the back lines of the two service boxes. This tape is the back edge of the "power zone", and the three red lines right near it make the rest of the "power zone" rectangle.

 2. From then on, just play regular squash, and note where you're standing when each point ends. Whenever you or your partner hit the last good shot from within the power zone, you earn two points instead of one. And if the receiver hits the final shot from within the zone, the receiver earns the right to serve and scores one point. Other than that, just play regular squash.

 3. You may want to adjust the rules to say that having one foot within the "power zone" counts as being fully within the zone, because that makes it easier to score double points.



 In no time, you'll be enjoying the power zone like never before. And you'll be playing better squash, and controlling the center of the court like a pro.
