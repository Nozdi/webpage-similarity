In a lot of ways, traveling in numbers means safety. Dangerous wildlife like moose, bears, and mountain lions are less likely to bother you when you're with others. They're more likely to hear a group coming than a single person -- and the more of you there are, the less vulnerable (and tasty) you look.

If you or someone else in your party gets hurt -- let's say you sprain an ankle or take a fall -- you're much better off with other people nearby, and their pooled resources, than if you were trying to limp back solo. Cold? Put a few people together and you'll generate a lot of body heat. Maybe someone else will have an emergency blanket they can wrap you up in, too.

Broken arm or wrenched shoulder? Letting someone else help you into a splint or sling is much easier than trying to do it yourself. Even if they don't know what else to do, the others in your party can hold your hand and buoy your spirits while somebody else hikes out to signal for help.

Despite all those reasons you should hike with others, for some people (and I'm one of them), the pull of solitude is very strong. I've learned to enjoy and appreciate hiking in groups, but for a long time there I was happiest on the trail by myself, miles away from the city and the next-nearest people.

If you're just starting out at hiking, there really shouldn't be any exceptions to the "traveling with others" rule. Stick with the group, period. But once you have enough experience to really "get" the risks you're taking, traveling solo becomes more of a viable (if not recommended) option. Here are a few things to keep in mind if you're going hiking alone:
