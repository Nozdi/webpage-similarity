Backhand Short Rail Drill - Face the Side Wall, Ready to Toss the Ball Stand On the Short Line, Facing the Side Wall, Ready to Hit Soft Backhands Along the Side Wall

To fine-tune your backhand shots along the wall, begin by facing the side wall and holding a ball in your non-racquet hand. Your racquet should already be taken back, and it is usually easiest to have your ball-holding arm above your racquet-holding arm. (Your ball toss is easiest that way.)
