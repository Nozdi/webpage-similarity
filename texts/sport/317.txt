Manchester City are a club on an upward trajectory.

Since being purchased in 2008 by the Abu Dhabi United Group, their owners have poured in millions with the aim of making City a genuine power in the world game.

The Arabs' first move was to sign Brazil forward Robinho from Real Madrid in a deal that smashed the club's previous transfer record. Many big names have arrived since, as City look to rid themselves of the traditional tag of underachievers, a club living in the shadow of their more illustrious neighbors Manchester United.

They won their first league title since 1968 in 2012 when Sergio Aguero's late winner on the last day of the season secured a dramatic victory over Queens Park Rangers.
