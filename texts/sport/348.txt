You are a beginner swimmer or a novice swimmer. You have the basics of a swimming workout figured out. You want to be a better swimmer, but once you get in the swim pool to get the swimming workout started, you feel a little lost? Don't know where to begin the swim workout? No swim coach to write a swimming work out for you?

Perhaps you are used to doing running workouts or bicycling workouts, and now want to add a swim workout to your regular workout routine, but think you are a weak swimmer and won't be able to do it? If you can swim four, 25 meter or 25 yard lengths of a pool, then you can use the Build to 500 Meters or Yards Swimming Workout Plan to build up to a swimming workout that totals 500 meters or 500 yards of swimming.

Maybe you are a beginner swimmer stuck in a workout rut, always swimming the same swim workout, week after week, and want to try something different? Here's a swimming plan to help you get fitter (and maybe faster) through progressive swimming workouts.

This swimming workout plan is divided into two, 4-week periods. Each 4-week period has three weeks of increasing work and one week of recovery. There are optional work outs to modify the plans for swimming two, three, or four times each week. The ground work is the same regardless of the number of swim workouts each week - you are going to build fitness and maintain or develop better technique.

Getting stronger but sloppier is not the answer; you need to develop or maintain your swimming technique, and you need to get fitter - you need both. While you do want to have the best technique possible, there is a balancing act between the current level of fitness and the ability to hold great technique. If you are not fit, you cannot do the stroke correctly.

My experiences show that it is like a teeter-totter. Increase fitness, improve technique; back and forth, focusing on one or the other as the primary emphasis of each swim workout set. Do not ignore either factor at any time, but do not try and develop both simultaneously. It becomes physically and/or mentally exhausting to always try to focus on both. It is very difficult to do both at the same time, and it can get very frustrating. We'll mix both exercise and skill development within a swimming workout, but seldom will you purposely place equal focus on both at the same time.

This is not necessarily the same type of plan that would be used by a high school, college, or club swimming program that is focusing on a peak performance during a certain period of the season, like a conference, state, or national championship. This workout plan is intended to meet general fitness needs. It can be adapted to fit almost any goals, from an aerobic exercise session to a workout plan for the swim leg of your next triathlon. This workout plan could repeated 6 times to give you almost a full year of workouts. As you get in better shape you will complete more repeats for a given section. You can repeat these workouts as you get fitter. Finally, remember to consult a physician before beginning any fitness regimen.

This is how it works:

I am going to assume that you are using a 25 yard pool; 2 lengths = 50 (yards), etc. If you are in a different size pool, adapt the workout accordingly.

The speeds to perform during a workout - Easy, Moderate, or Fast - are relative to you and your ability and are what you think they are for now.

Use drills for technique work during workouts, or have a friend or a lifeguard watch you swim and give you some feedback. You can find more on drills on the About Swimming Technique Pages. You may want to add some dryland strength work or stretching. Good luck with your swimming workout plan.
