It is not uncommon for new paintball players to want to own their own equipment. Not only will they have the chance to choose the gun they really want, but the gun will often out-perform rental equipment. Ownership, though, also comes with certain costs: the cost of the purchase and the cost of maintenance.

Before you rush in and purchase, take a minute and ask yourself a series of questions about whether you should buy your own gear. By going through these, you will have a pretty good idea whether purchasing is a good option for you.

Assuming you have decided that it is a good idea to purchase, there is still the issue of whether it is good to purchase now. If you are going to buy, think about where you will buy your paintball equipment from. As you do so, pay close attention to the price and the quality of the gun. You need to choose a gun appropriate for your current abilities and also for your abilities in the near future. My general recommendation is that if you can only afford the cheapest, most basic gun and equipment possible, you should not purchase right now. Save up your money and purchase a gun that is appropriate for you now but also lets you grow into for a little while. This doesn't mean you have to buy a high-end gun, but do buy something that gives you some room to grow.
