Everyone is interested in saving money. Paintball players, since many are younger and very early on in their careers, often place saving money at a high priority, particularly since paintball can cost quite a bit over time. With that interest in reducing the cost of paintball, there are many players that focus on "discount paintball."

I find it interesting that discount paintball comes up relatively frequently since it really doesn't have a defined meaning. As near as I can peg it, the term refers to getting anything related to paintball (paintballs, guns, air fills, field fees, etc.) for a reduced price. It's hardly ever referred to as "cheap paintball," but instead is always viewed as a discount. How, then, can you get paintball at a discount?

The easiest way to get paintball discounts is to look for them. There are deals to be found everywhere, so if you keep your eyes peeled, you'll find some.

If you are looking for deals on equipment, first look for used gear. Paintball equipment generally does not hold its value well, so look for something used that still works well.

If you want new gear, pay attention to sales. Online paintball stores make their money by selling huge volumes of equipment, so they need to constantly have the newest gear in stock. This means that they are regularly selling their older equipment at a discount. Nearly every holiday there are some significant sales, particularly with previous years' models of equipment.

For field fees, you simply have to keep an open mind on where and when you play. Look for fields that may be further away, but cost less. Also pay attention to deal sites such as Groupon that will sometimes have discount passes to fields. Some fields even sell season passes so you can pay once and then go regularly.

Paintball discounts, just like everything else, are available. Just keep your eyes open and find something that works for you.
