Killington

 Killington is located in Killington, Vermont. Killington is the largest destination resort in the Northeast and offering the highest gondola-serviced skiing in New England.

Ski Mogul Camp

 A mogul camp or clinic is like any other specialty learning experience. It is extended learning and practice in an immersion style. The mogul camp I attended at Killington consisted of five hours a day on the snow or in the bumps for two days on a Saturday and Sunday.
