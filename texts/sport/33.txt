Good hikers leave no trace -- but sometimes that takes a little more effort than just picking your trash up behind you. If we're not careful, there are other marks of our passage that can linger for years after we've gone by.

A lot of responsible hiking practices are good safety habits, too. For example, planning your route in advance means you're able to file a proper trip plan -- so if something goes wrong, rescuers will know when and where to start searching for you. The more you know about where you're going, the less likely you are to get lost. (But here's how to handle it if you do.)

Respecting wildlife is good for you, too -- usually that boils down to giving them lots of space and knowing how to read their signals. Doing so means you're less likely to be chased, to accidentally scare parent animals away from their young, and it helps protect your leashed or voice-controlled dog from getting into critter trouble too.
