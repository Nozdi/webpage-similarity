Definition: When three defenders are fielded, one is often used as a sweeper. It is the sweeper's job to play behind the other two central defenders, mopping up loose balls, passing/dribbling the ball out of defense and adding more security. Franz Beckenbauer and Franco Baresi are two of the most famous players to have played in the position, but the it is less common now.
