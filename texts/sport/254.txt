A big part of summer in Vermont is all about celebrating nature where crystal clear lakes and cool mountain air make for fun days and comfortable nights. Many of Vermont's ski resorts open their mountains to biking, hiking and scenic chairlift rides and fill the summer with concerts and events for the whole family. Then, of course, comes the unmatched beauty of fall foliage throughout Vermont, so when you come for the summer be sure to plan for the fall and then we're back for great winter fun.
