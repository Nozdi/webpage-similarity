They've now beaten both Barcelona and Real Madrid this season and on Wednesday Atletico Madrid's dream of an unlikely Champions League and La Liga double moved a step closer to reality.

After four draws with the Catalans this season, Atleti defeated Tata Martino's men 1-0 at the Vicente Calderon thanks to Koke's early goal.

The scoreline would have been comprehensive had the home side not wasted three or four more presentable chances in the first-half. They nonetheless won the tie 2-1 on aggregate to progress to their first European Cup semi-final in 40 years.

Atletico have done a superb job of negating the threat of Lionel Messi this season and that was again the case on Wednesday as the Argentine struggled to get a look-in, and again failed to score against Diego Simeone's superbly well-organized side.

As Barca defender Jordi Alba acknowledged after the game: "It's very difficult to beat a rival who play this way. It's hard to beat Atletico because of how they play".

The longer the match went on, the harder Barca found it to penetrate Atletico, who closed out comfortably in front of a raucous Calderon crowd.

Atletico lead La Liga with just six games to play. The way they performed against Barca over two legs will give them hope that they can pick up the desired result at Camp Nou in the final league match of the season.

If Atletico do pull off a stunning double, it will be one of the greatest achievements by a club side so far this century. They were in the Spanish second division as recently as 2002, were in financial disarray under previous owner Jesus Gil, have regularly had to sell their best strikers (Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao) and rely on a fraction of the budget of the teams standing in their way of glory this season.
