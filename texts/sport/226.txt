Racquetball Z Serve - The Standard Ready Position for the Racquetball Z Serve How Can the Receiver Know What Serve Is Coming? They Can't!

Begin your Z serve with the same ready position you use for the straight drive serve or for the crosscourt drive serve. Your feet are aligned just forward of the back service zone line, and your shoulders are facing the side wall. Your knees are bent, and your weight is mostly on your front foot, in anticipation of a cross-behind step with your rear foot.
