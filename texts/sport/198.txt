When you move in racquetball, be sure to stay in control, and don't overrun the ball. Overrunning a ball should be avoided, as it's hard to push off the walls, and as the walls themselves are hard.Similarly, when your opponent hits, be sure to give her/him the ability to hit to any part of the front wall. Getting in the way of the ball should be avoided.On a more serious note, you should always avoid your opponent's racquet (which can hurt you more seriously than the ball), and always wear eye protection.Don't let these "bloopers" scare you away. Having fun on the racquetball court is easy, and avoiding getting hurt is easy, too.
