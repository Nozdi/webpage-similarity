When you are playing a long rally in squash, trading deep shots along the side walls, it can be disconcerting to have your opponent suddenly hit the ball into the side wall. That shot is called a boast, and if your opponent hits it well, it means that the ball will end up in the far front of the court, leaving you to scramble to even reach it.Here's how to reach that ball with ease, and punish your opponent for his temerity.If you do these two simple things (always watch closely, and be sure to move forward right away), you will be amazed how you reach balls that you never used to reach. And you will have plenty of time to hit a good drop shot, and make your opponent run the full length of the diagonal on the court. It will be no fun for your opponent from now on!
