Stand facing your backhand side wall of the squash court, near the front of the service box. Your chest and hips should be facing the side wall. Look at the front wall to get your target point. You want to hit the volleys above the red line on the front wall and a few feet out from the side wall. Take your racquet back, and put your ball-tossing arm over top of your racquet arm so you can most easily start the drill.
