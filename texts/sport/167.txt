Stand in the Best Location for Receiving Most Serves

To start your serve return, stand in the service area on the opposite side of the court from the server. Stand so that you are facing halfway towards the front wall and halfway towards your side wall. You should be positioned about one foot behind and one foot to the side of the corner of the service box.
