Many people consider it fun to spend their weekends playing paintball. Many people also consider it fun to spend their weekends drinking. They should not be combined.

Alcohol and paintball do not mix. They should never be used together. They should never be considered together. They are a bad idea.

When people drink and play paintball they are being unsafe and are more likely to injure themselves and others. They are more likely to remove their mask or shoot their gun where they shouldn't. They are more likely to decide that it's okay to shoot things they shouldn't, or go driving and firing out the window.

Paintball and drinking don't mix. Don't do it. Don't try it. Don't let your friends, acquaintances or enemies do it. It's an all-around bad thing.
