The top three teams from this session and the top three from semifinal no. 1 advanced to the Super Six team finals, held on Apr. 19. Additionally, the top four gymnasts' scores (including ties) on each event qualified to the individual event finals held on Apr. 20.

Semifinal no. 2 of the 2014 NCAA Championships had two major surprises. First was the tie for first, which gave a hint as to what was to come in the team finals. Florida and Alabama tied for the top spot, but Florida won the tie-break (all six scores on each event were counted), giving the Gators the top seed going into the finals. The second huge surprise? Neither UCLA or Utah advanced to team finals. Nebraska upset them both by a tenth or less. (See our sadness about Utah and UCLA missing out, here.)

Alabama's Kim Jacob was named the 2014 NCAA All-Around Champ after scoring a 39.625 -- the highest total of either session. Bridget Sloan, the 2013 all-around champ, was on track to defend her title before falling on beam.
