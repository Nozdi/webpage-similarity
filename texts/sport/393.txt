This swim workout will push you to swim fast and faster. After warming up with swimming, technique and stroke work, kicking, and pulling, and then making sure you are ready to go by doing some quick 25s, the workout really starts.

There is a longer swim that should be done as a relaxed, steady effort; not easy, but more toward the easy end of the spectrum. Then there are two fast 50 swims, followed by two fast 25 swims. These fast swimming efforts should be very fast, the best you can do. Then you move on to another longer, relaxed swim effort, then back to the shorter, faster efforts. Repeat that workout pattern a few more times.

Want to do a longer workout? One option is to make the relaxed swim distances longer and keep the faster parts the same distance. Enjoy your swim workout!

Easy loosen to end the workout.TOTAL DISTANCE = 3,000

This workout is designed to take between 75-minutes and 90-minutes. If that is too much time or distance, then cut things out, but do not always cut out the same thing every workout. And never skip the loosen at the end of the workout. Use that as one last bit of technique work before you leave the swimming pool at the end of the workout.

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat five more times.

There is nothing special about these swim practice sessions other than what you bring to them. Lots of freedom here. You control how hard or fast you swim and what swim strokes you want to use while swimming the workouts. Normally the amount of rest per swim will limit your top-end speed on a workout, but that does not mean go as fast as you can all of the time. A few guidelines:
