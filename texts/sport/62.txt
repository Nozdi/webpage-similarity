Use the sizing chart below to find the right sized hybrid bike for you. Knowing your height and inseam measurements, you should be able to determine what size frame will be most comfortable for you. Of the two measurements, height and inseam, inseam is more important.

Hybrid bikes are generally measured in frame size (inches), which is the distance from the center of the crank to the top of the frame at the seat tube. The sizing is comparable to sizing of mountain bikes, which means they'll run a couple inches smaller than the road bike you'd probably ride.
