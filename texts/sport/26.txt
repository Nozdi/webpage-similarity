If you spend much time hiking in bear country, you probably carry bear spray (and if you don't, you should). Some folks also carry bear spray for protection from other types of predators.

But guess what? A charging bear (or mountain lion, or whatever else) isn't going to stop and wait while you take your pack off and dig around in it for your can of bear spray. And you should never count on having advance notice that a charge is coming.

So if you're carrying your spray anywhere that takes more than an instant for you to reach it -- which includes a side pocket of your pack that you can't reach yourself, or heaven forbid inside the pack -- you're doing it wrong. Here are some better ways to carry your bear spray securely:

Most holsters come with a strap that goes across the top of the can of bear spray, securing it in the holster. This is great for making sure you don't lose the spray if you break into a run, go crawling through the bushes or do a lot of squatting or crawling -- but it also slows your ability to use the bear spray in an emergency.

So if you use that strap, practice popping it off to get to your bear spray quickly -- just as you should practice popping the safety clip off the bear spray so you don't end up fumbling with it in an emergency. If you ever have to actually use it, you'll be grateful for having built the muscle memory.

Oh, and by the way -- if you're carrying bear spray, don't fall into these two myths about how to use it. Check out this most excellent bear spray video from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game instead.
