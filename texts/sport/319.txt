At the grand old age of 41, Mark Schwarzer could have a big say on the destination of this season's Champions League.

Chelsea's first-choice goalkeeper Petr Cech was ruled out for the remainder of the season after suffering a shoulder injury in the 0-0 draw with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. Schwarzer replaced the Czech at the Vicente Calderon and proved a safe pair of hands as Chelsea eased to a draw in Spain.

It looked as though Schwarzer was gently winding down his career until Cech's injury on Tuesday. He had started just eight games all season, used primarily when Jose Mourinho chose to rest Cech.

Now, in what could be a thrilling denouement to an excellent career, Schwarzer has been thrust into the limelight once again. If Chelsea are to repeat their Champions League heroics of 2012, the Australian will have to perform to his optimum because his side will need to get past Atletico in Wednesday's second leg and then either Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the final. An error in any of these high stake games could prove terminal.

Schwarzer made a costly error in last weekend's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland and any more will inevitably signal criticism for manager Jose Mourinho, who, the critics will argue, should not be relying on a 41-year-old for back-up to Cech, especially with the excellent Thibaut Courtois on loan at Atletico.

It remains to be seen whether Schwarzer will even play for Australia at this summer's World Cup, with coach Ange Postecoglou undertaking a rebuilding job.

Some convincing displays from Schwarzer between now and the end of the season may just make up Postecoglou's mind.
