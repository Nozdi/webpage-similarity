Sportsmanship is not very popular to talk about.  Not only do people not really get excited to have another sportsmanship lecture, but they don't go and read about it on their own.  (I know that because I can look at page views of my  articles, and sportsmanship articles are never very popular - similar to safety articles.)  It is, though, something that people need to be reminded of, so here I go again.

Sportsmanship is a big deal in sports.  It refers to how players interact with other players and how they act on and off the field.  It's also a big deal in Paintball.  Particularly when players carry a paintball gun that can literally hit someone from a hundred feet away, they need to be good sports and play the game as it was meant to be played.  This means that you play fair, play nice, treat others, and yourself, with respect, and you always play safe.  Sportsmanship is not simply a one-time event, but it is a process where you continually try to better yourself without belittling anyone else.

To look at it from another side, nobody likes a poor sport.  People that are unsafe, unfriendly, overly competitive or simply too full of themselves are not fun to play with or to be around.  People who come just because they think its an excuse to party or come to show off their manly abilities are not good for other players or for the sport.
