If you're going to spend some money on a paintball gun, at lest buy something that's going to serve you well. These are some of the best, cheap, entry-level paintball guns. All of these are purely mechanical paintball guns so no batteries are needed.

I highly recommend each of these guns to the beginning paintball player who wants a serviceable gun that doesn't cost a fortune. They are presented in no particular order.
