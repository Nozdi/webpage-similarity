This swimming workout starts with a good effort 800, but you take a very short stop 1/2 way through it to get your time to use as a goal for the next swim, a 400. You try to swim faster through the workout as the distance you swim decreases. During the warm-up there are several sets descending of 50's; you swim at an easy effort on the first 50, a little faster on the second 50, faster on the third, and fastest on the fourth.

This workout is designed to take between 75-minutes and 90-minutes. If that is too much time or distance, then cut things out, but do not always cut out the same thing every workout. And never skip the loosen at the end of the workout. Use that as one last bit of technique work before you leave the swimming pool at the end of the workout.

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat six times.

There is nothing special about these swim practice sessions, other than what you bring to them. Lots of freedom here. You control how hard or fast you swim and what swim strokes you want to use while swimming the workouts. Normally the amount of rest per swim will limit your top-end speed on a workout, but that does not mean go as fast as you can all of the time. A few guidelines:
