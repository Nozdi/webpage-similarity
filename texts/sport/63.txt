If you view this bike as an investment to be used for several years, you can justify spending a little more up front.

David, an about.com reader took this approach for his son.

"After speaking with the great people at our local bike shop we decided to get him an XXS frame Raleigh mountain bike. We then put slick tires on and he uses it as a street bike," says David.

"With the extra tires it still cost about $350 but this way he has a road bike now. When he gets bigger we can put the original mountain bike tires back on and he'll have a mountain bike to go with the road bike he gets at that time. This way, even though we did spend a bit more for his current bike with the extra tires, it is something he will use for years to come."
