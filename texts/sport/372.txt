This swim workout is aimed at speed-endurance. After the warm-up, swim the 50's at the best pace possible without blowing up. A speed that you can hold for all of the 50s, but just barely; stay on the safe side of blowing up, but get close to that edge. For the 25s, control is out the window. Go as fast as you can, and expect to get slower as you work through the 25s. Feel free to take extra rest between the firs set of 50s and 25s and the second set.

This workout is designed to take between 75-minutes and 90-minutes. If that is too much time or distance, then cut things out, but do not always cut out the same thing every workout. And never skip the loosen at the end of the workout. Use that as one last bit of technique work before you leave the swimming pool at the end of the workout.

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat five more times.

There is nothing special about these swim practice sessions other than what you bring to them. Lots of freedom here. You control how hard or fast you swim and what swim strokes you want to use while swimming the workouts. Normally the amount of rest per swim will limit your top-end speed on a workout, but that does not mean go as fast as you can all of the time. A few guidelines:
