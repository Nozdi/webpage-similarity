Your stem is the part of the bike that attaches the handlebars to the fork. It's a key part of your steering, and what channels your action on the handlebars into the front wheel being pointed in the direction you want to go.

The size of a stem varies between bikes of course but in general it's usually about as long as the width of your hand. A small adjustment in the stem length can make a big difference in the way things feel. Just 10-20 mm difference in length can have a significant impact on a rider--whether one feels overly stretched out, or tucked in and nice and comfortable. Most of the time, you can only accomplish this change by swapping out the stem completely.
