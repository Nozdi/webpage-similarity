A map and compass are vital emergency supplies, but make sure you know how to use them -- before you hit the trail.

Make sure that doesn't happen to you by making a packing list. This is a great practice to follow before every hike, but it's especially important on your first few trips, when you might not be sure what you'll need during the hike. Here are a few things you should always take along, no matter how long or short, popular or deserted, the trail may be:

The longer and more remote your hikes get, the more you'll need to carry to be properly prepared. The classic "Ten Essentials," first published in Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills, has long been considered the bible of what to carry on any hike or expedition:
