The author and Brett Kistler do a two-way linked exit from the Balinghe Bridge in China.

BASE jumping is the sport of jumping, while wearing a one-parachute safety system, from non-moving objects. It differs from skydiving in that skydives are performed from aircraft (a definition which includes airplanes, balloons, paragliders, microlights and any other flying vehicle). Skydives are also generally performed wearing two parachutes -- one primary and one backup.

The term "BASE" is an acronym. It stands for:

These are the four objects from which BASE jumpers most commonly leap. Other objects (for instance billboards, wind turbines and high-altitude cables) also count as BASE objects if the exit point is static.

Beyond that, there is no better definition but the one given by athlete/author Matt Gerdes in The Great Book of BASE. Matt writes: "BASE jumping is "at once an intense adventure sport, a hobby, a crime, a passion, a profession and a pastime."
