Hydrodynamics play a vital role in swimming performance. In fact, drag is believed to be the largest contributor for swimming performance. Although not as important, force production also plays a role in swimming success. For example, the timing of force production is important for not only forward velocity, but also efficiency. Another topic lacking adequate discussion is the direction of force and it's role in swimming velocity. Like timing of force, direction of force is just as important for swimming efficiency as swimming velocity. Many unskilled swimmers begin producing force during the entry of the hand, creating downward force. This force not only waste energy by requiring more muscular contractions, but also requires the body to use more energy for counteracting this creation of force and maintain streamline and prevent drag. For instance, if a swimmer do create force upon the hand entry, then the body has two options:

Both of these scenarios use more energy and both likely slow down the swimmer, as maintaining streamline is difficult even in the second scenario.

The proper time for force production in swimming is easily understood, but difficult for implementation. Sir Issac Newton proposed each action has an opposite and equal reaction and swimming force production is no different. For forward force production, a swimmer must move their arm directly backward. Positioning the arm in a backward position is termed an "early vertical forearm" in the sport and is achieved through internal rotation of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. However, the forearm isn't the only application for force production, as the upper arm also plays a role in forward production
