The USA has the highest concentration of indoor skydiving facilities in the world. However, if you're not local to the US - or of you feel like adding some faux freefall to your overseas vacation - there are plenty of options scattered around the world (especially in Europe, southeast Asia and the Middle East).

The facilities listed below are permanent, civilian structures specifically built for human bodyflight. I have not listed mobile bodyflight outfits, as such facilities are inappropriate for serious bodyflight training (or for persons interested in learning to skydive).

If you have additional notes regarding any of the below tunnels, please drop me a line at extremesports@about.com. I'd love to consider them for inclusion.
