Question: Where Can You Fill CO2 Tanks?

Carbon Dioxide or CO2 is filled by moving the compressed liquid form of the gas from a larger tank to a smaller, paintball-sized CO2 tank. The key to filling the smaller tank is to find a store that stocks the larger tanks and has the appropriate equipment to fill the smaller tanks.

One of the best places to fill a CO2 tank is at a paintball store or a paintball field. Most stores and fields stock CO2 and have all the appropriate equipment to adequately fill without over-filling your tanks.Sporting goods stores such as Dicks Sporting Goods and Sports Authority often will fill CO2 tanks. Sporting goods stores are easy to find and usually do a great job at filling tanks, though if you get an inexperienced person helping you, there is the risk that they will over-fill your tank which can result in a burst safety disk.

Some stores have tank exchanges where you can drop off an empty tank and leave with another pre-filled tank.

Pre-filled tanks are available at many large retailers. These single-use tanks are relatively small, but they are a great backup.If you plan on playing paintball often, you may want to consider buying your own CO2 bulk tank and fill station. With your own supplies you can fill up the larger tank at a CO2 supplier and then fill your individual tanks at your convenience.
