There's a fun squash game called "Moat Man" (or Alligator, if you're a girl) that can help you learn to volley the ball more, and keep you from getting stuck in the back corners of the court. 



 Here's how to play:

 1. Put a piece of colored tape on the floor of the court, going from one side to the other, about one foot behind the back lines of the service boxes. The "moat" goes from this tape to the back wall. The "moat" is filled with alligators.

 2. From then on, just play regular squash, being careful not to step in the moat. If you step in the moat, you lose the point immediately.

 3. You may want to adjust the rules to say that putting just a toe or one foot into the moat is okay.

 4. Be sure to keep the ball from going into the moat so you don't have to go in after it! Volleying the ball in the air is a good way to do this.



 In no time, you'll be cutting off your opponent's deep shots like never before. And you'll be playing better squash, volleying aggressively like a pro, and staying out of those troublesome back corners of the court.
