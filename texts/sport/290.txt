The American Cup is an international meet, held early in the competitive season and one of the few held in the US. (Other competitions, such as the Pacific Rim Challenge, Pan American Games, and World Championships have occasionally been held in the US as well, and these are considered, for the most part, to be bigger competitions.) The location changes yearly, but is always in the US.

While there is a rich history of great gymnasts competing at the American Cup, in recent years, the event has been almost exclusively won by Americans. This is due in part to the recent US dominance in the sport especially on the women's side, and in part to the field, which sometimes has a weaker international roster than the American one.

The competition format and rules vary from year to year -- some years have had up to four Americans competing in an eight-member field. In recent years, the American Cup has been an official World Cup competition, meaning the field and rules are dictated by the FIG. In general, that lends itself to a stronger competitive roster.
