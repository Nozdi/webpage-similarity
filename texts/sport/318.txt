In one of the most enthralling games of the Premier League season, Liverpool took the box seat in the title race with a 3-2 win over Manchester City.

On a day when Anfield remembered the 96 people who perished in the Hillsborough disaster 25 years ago, Liverpool took a 2-0 half-time lead through Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel.

City hit back impressively despite losing Yaya Toure to injury and looked like they had secured a 2-2 draw - a common scoreline between these sides at Anfield in recent times - when the excellent David Silva netted from close range and Glen Johnson put through his own net.

But a shocking mis-kick from the usually reliable Vincent Kompany gifted the ball to Philippe Coutinho and the Brazilian rifled past Joe Hart with a first time shot.

This freewheeling Liverpool side are a joy to watch. They play with a care-free abandon and do not look like a team bogged down by the intense pressure of such a close Premier League title race.

They have produced some of the best counterattacking performances the Premier League has seen in recent years - just ask Arsenal and Everton who were beaten by four goals on their visits to Anfield earlier this season.

The sight of captain Steven Gerrard holding back the tears at the final whistle hammered home the importance of this result, although there is still work to do.

The Reds lead Chelsea by two points and City by seven, although Manuel Pellegrini's side still have two games in hand.

Liverpool's remaining fixtures see them play Norwich, Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Newcastle. Win against Jose Mourinho's side on April 27, and a first title in 24 years will surely be theirs..
