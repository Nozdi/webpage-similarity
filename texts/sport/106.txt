A drop zone -- "DZ," for short -- is a facility where parachutists take off in aircraft and land under personal ram-air canopies. These are often on the grounds of small general aviation airports or airfields.

At recreational drop zones, a specific area is designated as the appropriate space for parachute landings, marked with wind indicators and described to new-arriving jumpers in detail by the DZ staff.

"Drop zone" can also refer, generally in a military context, to the designated place where cargo will land under parachute.
