Now into his 30s, Xavi's greatest attribute is his passing. Capable of being both economic or expansive in possession, Xavi can dictate a game's rhythm. He has become invaluable for Barcelona as the years have gone on, and although not a prolific scorer from midfield (he has only got into double figures once in his career), his runs into the box and ability to take free-kicks are invaluable for club and country. One of the very best central midfielders of the last 10 years.
