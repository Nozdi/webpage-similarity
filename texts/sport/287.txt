A split is one of those moves that is really easy for some people and much harder for others. Even if you're as tight as can be, though, you'll still be able to master it if you work hard at your stretching. 



 A great way to get (or improve) your split is to move through a series of different stretches, from simple to advanced. If you are a beginner, you'll probably want to master the easier stretches first before moving on to full split stretches. 



 Be sure to do each stretch on both sides - you'll want a good split on both your right leg and your left leg in order to be a great gymnast.
