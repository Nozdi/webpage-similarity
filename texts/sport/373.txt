This swim workout works you through a series of 200s, with three faster swims, then a recovery, two faster swims, then a recovery, then on final last fast swim. Do your best to keep the fast swims fast but even paced. The goal is not to swim the 200s as fast as possible and fall apart, but to go at a fast speed that you can maintain for all of the 200s without breaking down. You might not be able to do that the first time you do this swim workout, but try it a few times over several weeks and you will get it.1,2002 x 200 (:20 Swim and drill mix.

This workout is designed to take between 75-minutes and 90-minutes. If that is too much time or distance, then cut things out, but do not always cut out the same thing every workout. And never skip the loosen at the end of the workout. Use that as one last bit of technique work before you leave the swimming pool at the end of the workout.

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat five more times.

There is nothing special about these swim practice sessions other than what you bring to them. Lots of freedom here. You control how hard or fast you swim and what swim strokes you want to use while swimming the workouts. Normally the amount of rest per swim will limit your top-end speed on a workout, but that does not mean go as fast as you can all of the time. A few guidelines:
