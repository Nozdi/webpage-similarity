Mont Tremblant has been a perennial in surveys rating Best Resorts in the East. The base village and connected Casino reminds one of a European ski resort and the trails are classic eastern style runs. The resort is located 1 1/2 hour north of Montreal, Quebec, Canada with 95 ski trails, served by 14 lifts on over 600 acres of skiable terrain.

Mont Tremblant has been a favorite ski destination for many, many years going back to the famous ski trains of the 1930s. Today Mont Tremblant is the perennial eastern resort skiers' favorite,  blending a European style village and gaming Casino with classic eastern ski trails.

Mont Tremblant Village is the closest to a European alpine ski resort village this side of the pond. An early stroll on a crisp Quebec morning highlights the unique architecture and brings out the ambiance so appreciated by skiers and year round vacationers.

Renting a chalet for a ski vacation is a common practice at European ski resorts. I can't think of a better place to choose a ski chalet vacation on this side of the pond than at Mont Tremblant.
