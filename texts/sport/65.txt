This is a tire for a mountain bike. Notice the wide knobs on the tread. These give good traction on off-road riding, as they grip well on dirt, sand, rocks and other irregular terrain.

Mountain bike tires usually are not inflated as high as road bike tires. You want them to be softer so that they can grip the ground better and give you a more comfortable ride.
