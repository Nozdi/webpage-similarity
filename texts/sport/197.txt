Kids' squash starts at about age two. At least, that's when you can begin to give your child a lot of fun on court. And you don't really have to be an obsessed squash mom or squash dad to begin. 



If you play squash, and you're at the courts, where might your child naturally be? On court, or right behind it, wanting to get in with you!

Time Required: Two years or so (ages 2 to 4)
