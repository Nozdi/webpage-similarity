Jay Peak Resort, Killington Resort, and Sugarbush Resort will be spinning lifts and shredding soft bumps and groomer track on over 50 trails this first weekend in May.

Saturday, May 3, 2014 marks the 192nd day in operation for Killington Resort. That adds up to over six months of skiing and riding, and made it possible for skiers and riders to ski 8 out of 12 months of the year; and there is no end in near sight.

"Killington is approaching day 200 of this season, and we are excited for yet another May on snow," said Killington Communications Manager Michael Joseph. "We received over four inches of fresh snow last week and remain optimistic about our spring skiing outlook; so much so that we have not yet set a closing date."

Jay Peak's bragging rights don't stop at being open in May. They have the most terrain open with 38 trails and an average of 15-30" of base snowpack.

"No one up here can remember ever having close to 50% of our trails open in May," said Jay Peak's JJ Toland. "Even the duct tape-wrapped diehards are ready to see some grass. We're all ready for a nap."

But don't think Vermont resorts are starting to hibernate in spring. Sugarbush will be opening their golf course along with re-opening 18 trails on Saturday so you can get the best of both worlds.

"To be able to stay open this late into the season with 18 trails is amazing," said Sugarbush Communications Coordinator John Bleh. "Not only that, but our golf course is opening this weekend, so we'll have 18 trails to ski and 18 holes to golf!"
