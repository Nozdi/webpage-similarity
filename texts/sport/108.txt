Flying in the wind tunnel at Airkix Manchester in the UK

Bodyflight is the skill of moving the human body in a coordinated manner in a column of air (either in the sky or in a vertical wind tunnel). Many skydivers use the latter as a training environment for the skill.

Bodyflight maneuvers and techniques include turns, rolls, carving, lateral movement, control of the body's fall rate, changes to the body's orientation to the ground and a range of other airborne acrobatics.

Bodyflight skill allows for the refinement of skydiving maneuvers, including the flying of multiple skydivers in formation and the "break-off," or final separation of that group of skydivers using the discipline of tracking.

Bodyflight can be practiced in the sky, during skydiving free fall. It can also be practiced in a vertical wind tunnel (commonly known as "indoor skydiving"). There are dozens of wind tunnels around the world, both in America and overseas.
