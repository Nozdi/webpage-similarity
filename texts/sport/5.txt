There was a reader question about moose safety the other day, so I think now's a good time to recap what you can do to prevent a bad moose encounter.

If nothing else, keep in mind that the general advice for avoiding moose encounters is the same as avoiding a bear encounter: Know where they tend to hang out, keep all your senses alert for signs of their presence, and make plenty of noise so they can hear you coming and clear out before your paths intersect.

But when it comes to managing an encounter, the moose and bear strategies are polar opposites. With bears you DO NOT RUN; with a moose, you DO RUN. That's because moose don't have the predatory instincts a bear does, so your running will not trigger them to chase -- but if you surprise a moose and don't run for it, you may get kicked or stomped. And those hooves are deadly.

Another thing to keep in mind with both species is that you should never, ever get between (or even close to) a mother and her young. With calving season coming up in May and June, expect cow moose to be more aggressive than usual.

And finally, if you have children, they sometimes struggle to keep straight how they should behave around these big animals -- so why not hold moose and bear drills to help them keep their responses straight? The idea is exactly the same as doing a fire drill: practice makes perfect, and gives your children the extra confidence of being sure they know what to do.
