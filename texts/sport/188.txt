Squash Serve - Get In The Service Box Prepare Your Target On The Front Wall

To prepare to serve, get at least one foot fully into the service box. Your foot must not touch any red line, and it must touch the floor throughout your racquet's contact with the ball during the serve. 



 Thanks to squash professional Jonathan Lam for this demonstration.
