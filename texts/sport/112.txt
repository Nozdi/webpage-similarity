A ram-air parafoil is a modern type of self-inflating airfoil that allows its pilot to control the parachute's speed and direction.

Paragliding wings, speedwings, skydiving canopies (except in the case of round-shaped parachutes used for military and cargo delivery) and BASE jumping canopies are all examples of ram-air parafoils.

Skydiving and BASE canopies are designed for the stresses of deployment at terminal velocity.

All ram-airs have similar design cornerstones. All have two layers of fabric: the top skin and the bottom skin. These layers are connected to each other with fabric ribs. The spaces between the ribs are called "cells," and they are sewn closed at the back, or "tail," of the canopy. The cells inflate with the introduction of air through the "nose": the vented spaces at the front, or leading, edge of the ram-air.

The shape of the fabric and the way the lines are attached to the bottom of the canopy work together to form the inflated fabric into a stiff airfoil. In some cases, the design of the canopy uses one-way valves, called "airlocks," to hold air inside the system and reduce the possibility of deflation.

An athlete steers and lands a ram-air canopy using, among other inputs, two control lines, commonly simply referred to as "brakes." These brakes are attached along the rear of the wing, close to the back sides. When the athlete pulls the toggles connected to these control lines, the wing slow down. For a moment, the input causes the athlete to swing forward and pitches the angle of the wing upward (similarly to the method of an airplane's landing).
