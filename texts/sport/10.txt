It's come to my attention that when I wrote these three questions you can use to lighten up your pack, I left out what may be the most important question of all:

"Can duct tape do that?"

Bear with me -- I'm mostly serious here. If you've gone through those three questions and your pack is still too heavy, you may be carrying too many "just in case" items. It's not that I'm against carrying emergency supplies -- far from it! -- and you should carry as much as you need to feel comfortable in the conditions you're likely to face. But it's easy to forget that your emergency supplies (like duct tape) are the "just in case" items and carry unnecessary duplicates that turn into nothing but extra weight.

Ergo the question. If you're already carrying duct tape, do you really need a patch kit for your backpack(!), a spare pack buckle, or a sewing kit for repairing your clothes? No -- as long as you're planning something less than a months-long expedition, duct tape can do all of those things well enough to keep you comfortable until you either finish the hike or hit your next resupply opportunity.

So really, this is just a variation on the whole "Could I use something else instead?" query. After all, one of the keys to carrying a light pack without sacifricing comfort is finding items that can serve multiple purposes.

You can play the same game with just about any other emergency and comfort items in your pack -- for example, if you have skinny cordage along as an emergency supply, do you really need to carry extra shoelaces or a few more tent guy lines than you think you'll need? No -- the cordage can serve both of those functions. Do you really need to carry both a bandana and a pack towel? Maaaaaybe, depending on the specifics of your trip... but usually not.

You get the idea. Because when you get right down to it, if you can carry a lighter pack without sacrificing on preparedness -- why wouldn't you?
