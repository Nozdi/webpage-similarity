A 2012 Olympic alternate, Elizabeth Price won the American Cup and Pacific Rim Championships earlier this year, as well as the 2013-14 World Cup series. She seemed to be fast-becoming an American star, and even beat 2012 Olympian Kyla Ross in the all-around at Pacific Rims.

So many were surprised to see her announce that she'll attend Stanford this fall and join their gymnastics team, opting to skip this year's worlds, and by default, ending any chance at a 2016 Olympic team berth as well.

Though I don't doubt that she would have been in the hunt for a world all-around medal in October, she'll also be an absolute star in the NCAA. I hope she can help Stanford finally get to the top tier at NCAAs.
