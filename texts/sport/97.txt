If you've never had a cutaway, you probably have no idea. You might be super-confident landing your main canopy in some pretty hairy situations, but be warned: your reserve is a different story.

Little nervous now? You should be. Sweep those nerves away by taking the steps to ensure you know how to fly that emergency parachute that's patiently waiting on top of your main.

Demos aren't just for skydivers in the process of buying a new system. Even if you already have a reserve canopy waiting in the wings atop your main, you can reach out to the manufacturer and ask for a demo canopy. When it arrives, have your rigger help you trade your main canopy for the demo reserve and put a few jumps on it.

If you really don't "get along" with the canopy - even with a little help from a canopy coach - you can try out alternatives using the same method. Once you find a model that's confidence-inspiring, you'll be better prepared to handle the eventuality of a cutaway.

Once you have a demo reserve hooked up as a main canopy, you can run some drills - and make them fun, too.

You don't have to DIY if you don't want to. Performance Designs, one of the world's key canopy manufacturers, puts on an event that's custom-built for the purpose of introducing skydivers to their emergency parachutes.

Debuted at Skydive Zephyrhills in fall of 2013, the manufacturer's "Reserve Accuracy Challenge" gets skydivers hooked up to PD reserves as main canopies, then drops them over a Florida backyard that's been mocked up using a bunch of inflatable obstacles - palm trees, pool, and flamingoes - delineated with pool noodles. The event challenges jumpers to execute a tiptoe landing inside the "backyard" under the reserve canopy.

The event balances a sense of playfulness with the very real skill-building of accuracy landing a new kind of canopy. Reach out to PD to get on the interest list for the next scheduled event.
