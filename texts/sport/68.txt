Bike rodeos offer kids a chance to try out their cycling skills and learn how to ride safely.

Looking for a way to entertain a group of kids that is also educational at the very same time? A bike rodeo is a great choice for elementary and middle school kids, because it teaches them safe riding habits and hones their cycling skills. Plus they have a ball in the process!

At the minimum, all you'll need is a flat, paved surface such as a parking lot where the kids can ride safely, some cones, and chalk or tape for marking some of the games.
