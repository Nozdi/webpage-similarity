This sprint swimming challenge workout is all about speed. Once you are warmed up, you start each set with a strong effort, take your rest, and then push your swimming speed up a little bit more. There are easy recovery swims between each group of four faster efforts, and the workout concludes with four swims that ask you to test your own limits. Enjoy, sprinters!

After the description of the set there is a number in a half-parentheses, like this - (:30 - that is how much rest you get after each swim. For example, 6 x 100 (:30 means you are to swim a 100 (yards or meters), rest 30-seconds, then repeat five more times.
