The next major swimming competition after the 2012 Olympics is the 2013 World Swimming Championships in Barcelona. World championships in open water swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, and pool swimming will be contested between 19 July and 4 August 2013. The open water portion of world champs is 20-27 July. The pool swimming is 28 July - 4 August. I am looking forwad to the world's best getting back into the water for head-to-head racing. Michael Phelps is retired, will anyone take his crown?
