Paintball is a sport. It is composed of opposing teams, fixed objectives and requires physical activity and fast-paced movement. It's true that it is different from basketball and football, but so are tennis, javelin throwing and diving.

Paintball is not limited to any one form and can be played indoors (speedball), outdoors (speedball and woodsball) and comes in many different variations.
