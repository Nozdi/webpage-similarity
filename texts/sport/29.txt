There are only about half a billion things you could buy for the hiker in your life. In this gift guide, I've cut through the chaff and selected my favorite items in the $20 to $100 price range. If you have a little more to spend, check out the price is no object gift guide (everything costs $100 or more). If you're working with a limited budget, I've also assembled a gift guide of items that all cost $20 or less (but I promise your hiker will still appreciate them and be able to use them). And finally, most of the best books for hikers cost $20 or less, too.

No matter which price range you're shopping in, outdoor retailers known for their inexpensive prices are a great place to start looking for gift items. Now, without further ado, on to the gear!
