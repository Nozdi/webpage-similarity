Wow. US Squash just announced a very BIG decision today; namely, the switch to the squash point-a-rally (PAR) scoring system (with games played to 11 points) versus the more common international scoring system (in which only the server can score points, and with games played to 9 points).This will definitely reward those players who like to shoot for winners when returning serve! That tactic is not well-rewarded in the international scoring system, but it sure can earn you a quick point in a PAR squash match.Time to shoot for winners!
