I go into sticker stock every time I visit the shoe section of a sporting goods store. Really? They want me to pay more than $100 for footwear that I'm buying with the express intention of abusing it until it falls apart? On the other hand, your hiking shoes or boots will be the foundation of your every experience on the trail. You can't get far without them, and an ill-fitting pair can subject you to a smorgasbord of agonies from blisters to frozen, cramped, or sweaty feet.

In other words, expensive hiking boots are worth the cost -- if they live up to their promises. Quality hiking footwear is sturdy enough to protect your feet as you hike for miles, sensitive enough that you can feel your connection to the trail, and comfortable enough that -- if sized properly and worn with the right socks -- you'll rarely, if ever, have to deal with blisters, damaged toenails, and other symptoms of poorly fitted shoes.

The bad news is that there's no single cookie-cutter answer to which hiking boots are best, and there's really no way to be sure which boots will fit you well when shopping online (although you can measure your feet at home). However, once you actually have the boots in your hands, a few quick tests will show if they're right for you. Here's how to get ready:

*Many sporting goods stores offer an angled chunk of rock or a ramp to facilitate this. If they don't, get creative -- maybe you can leave your car keys or ID as collateral while you take the boots outside to jog up or down a nearby slope. The incline doesn't have to be long -- just a few feet is plenty.

**Don't let anyone convince you that these problem areas will go away as the boot breaks in. Very heavy-duty boots may soften up and form to your foot with use, but they should still fit properly (and reasonably comfortably) from the get-go. The one exception is the ankle cuff on leather boots, which should soften up with time and use. Lighter boots and hiking shoes need little to no break-in period at all.
