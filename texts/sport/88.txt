While skydivers are often made keenly aware of every obstacle during the dropzone's often-obligatory orientation for new jumpers, such detailed introductions are a rare luxury in ground-launched airsports. Self-assessed landing areas -- such as those we find when we're paragliding, speed flying or BASE jumping -- require sharp eyes. Avoiding trees, rocks and bushes is a pretty straightforward endeavor, as those objects are highly local (and their bulk makes them easily identifiable from the air). Power lines are much trickier, as their thin tracery of wires extends for long, almost invisible distances over the ground.

A landing in power lines has a tendency to seriously ruin an airsports athlete's day. Read on to learn the best tricks to stay well away from them.
