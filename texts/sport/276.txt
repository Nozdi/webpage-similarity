The top three teams from this session and the top three from semifinal no. 2 advanced to the Super Six team finals, held on Apr. 19. Additionally, the top four gymnasts' scores (including ties) on each event qualified to the individual event finals held on Apr. 20.

Oklahoma looked spot-on to win the session, with Georgia surprising a bit by finishing second, ahead of LSU.
