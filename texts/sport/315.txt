Four times World Player of the Year, Messi is by some distance the best player on the planet. His ability to mesmerize defenders with a mix of skill and pace is unmatched and it often appears as though the ball is glued to his feet. The Barcelona star is versatile enough to play anywhere across the frontline, but his country Argentina have so far failed to find a way to get the maximum out of this extraordinary talent. Already one of the best soccer players of all time.
