Your clues this week are:Please email me your guesses over the coming week. I'll post the winner and correct answer with next week's guessing game. Good luck!The set of clues didn't seem that easy, but nearly everyone knew that it was Picasso and his Mama. (Many of you were also winners of my top secret Pithy Picasso Comment award.) I can't single anyone out because Sandy knocked me offline for a while and all of the answers came in at the same time. So congratulations, All, and thanks for participating!
