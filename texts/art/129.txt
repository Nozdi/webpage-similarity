I have tried to work on the complementary colors: blue and orange, surrounded by different kinds of "black". The bottle is slightly on the left of the middle and both paintbrush and tubes are diagonally to create the depth. I have used mastic varnish and linseed oil as in the past. It was very nice to use this mixture.

Thanks to the dash of bright yellow of the tube on the right, I have tried to boost the eyes of the viewer to cross the canvas from the left (soft blue) to the right (bright yellow) but passing through the crenelated white cap of the bottle in order to avoid a too straight horizontal reading.
