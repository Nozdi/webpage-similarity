Definition:  Mimetic, or mimic, architecture is a programmatic approach to building design. Buildings are shaped to mimic, or copy, their function or to suggest objects associated with their function.

The mid-twentieth century was the heyday of mimetic architecture. Commercial buildings were designed to catch the attention of potential customers. A coffee shop might be shaped like a coffee cup. A diner might be painted to resemble a hot dog. Even the most inattentive passerby would know instantly what was featured on the menu.

Example: One famous example of mimetic architecture is the Longaberger Company corporate headquarters in Ohio, more commonly known as the Basket Building. The company manufactures baskets, so the architecture of the building becomes a way to promote their product.
