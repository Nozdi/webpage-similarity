The work of South African artist Richard Scott is characterized by thick black lines, flat color, and white subjects. Whether you think he's inspired, or paints like a child, his work is certainly distinctive. In this book showcasing his work he reveals much about himself, his paintings, and his motivation. For once the publisher's blurb isn't hyperbole, it truly is "The story of the mind of an artist illustrated by his art."

Richard Scott says in his introduction: "This book started out as a concept to market myself. It ended up being a book of facts about me and my art. A mini autobiography, if you like." Well, it may be mini in format (approx 4x4"/10x10cm), but it's not minimal in terms of information.

Each painting (or group of related paintings) has its double page spread, with a photo of it on the one side and the details (name, size, medium) and comments on it by the artist on the other. Positive or negative, it's a glimpse into the memory of the artist regarding a particular work or period. For example, on page 156, an painting called "Olive Face", elicits the comment: "This is one of three works where I coloured in the face of the subject. I am not sure what I was trying to achieve. I think I might have been bored with the plain olive and spontaneously added in the orange. I kind of liked the result."

For me the most interesting aspect was finding out more about how Scott comes up with ideas for subjects, and develops them, managing to come up with fresh ways of using his distinctive style. You'll be (pleasantly) surprised as how compelling and easy a read it is. You're left feeling as if you've walked through a gallery with the artist listening to him chat about his art.
