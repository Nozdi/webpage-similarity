What architecture stirs your heart? Contenders may include a place, like Portmeirion, Wales or Celebration, Florida . It might be a type of architecture, like Romantic Castles or the World's Tallest Skyscrapers.

Or it might be a house style or your dream of building your own home. Have you been seduced by architecture? Out of the whole world, which buildings do you find the most pleasing?
