Figure painting definitely a subject where regularly painting studies (or sketching figures) rewards you when you start painting a larger work, as well as producing the occasional pleasant surprise when something turns out as a strong work in itself. This photo gallery provides examples of figure studies and sketches done for general practise, trying a specific technique, and copies of work by famous painters. Some were done in a life drawing workshop, some from memory, some using photo references such as the Virtual Pose books, and some self-portraits using a mirror. Each has comments with it about what the aim or intention was.
