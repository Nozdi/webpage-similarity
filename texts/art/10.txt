Your clues this week are deliberately short:Please email me your guesses over the coming week. I'll post the winner and correct answer with next week's guessing game. Good luck!The artist in question when last we met was Jan Matejko (Polish, 1838-1893), and the portrait was of Boleslaw III (a.k.a.: Boleslaw the Wrymouth; 1086-1138), Prince of Poland from 1107 to 1138. Yolanta from Toronto knew this immediately, and assured me that it was an easy challenge if one has a Polish background -- which, I discovered, many,readers do. Congratulations to Yolanta, and thanks to all who participated!
