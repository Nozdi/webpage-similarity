You might think that architect Frank Lloyd Wright was too ego-centric to fall deeply and hopelessly in love. But in the early 1900s, Wright's passion for Mamah Borthwick lead him to sacrifice family, reputation, and career.

Fleeing gossip that surrounded their illicit romance, the already-married Frank Lloyd Wright built Taliesin, a Wisconsin retreat where he could work in peace and begin a new life with Mamah. Soon after they settled into the Prairie Style house, a disgruntled worker wielding an ax murdered seven people and set Taliesin on fire. Wright returned from a business trip to find his lover dead and their home in ruins.

The grieved Frank Lloyd Wright rebuilt Taliesin from the debris. He continued to spend summers there until he died, 45 years later.

Author Nancy Horan fictionalized the love affair in her novel, Loving Frank.
