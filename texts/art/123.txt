If you feel intimidated by the mere words "color theory" yet wish you could get to grips with the fundamentals, then this DVD will provide a friendly way in. It's not a quick fix, there's too much information presented and you'll need to work through the exercises to make the knowledge your own. But it's presented in a non-intimidating way, and if your motivation drags, looking at the glorious color in the paintings of Richard Robinson on the DVD cover is sure to inspire you to keep at it.

In his Mastering Color DVD Richard Robinson says his aim is to teach you how to "accurately measure color, understand its relationship to other colors, mix that same color on the palette and how to adjust color to suit your own creative endeavors." And that's just what he does. Though you won't learn it if you simply sit and watch the DVD from the comfort of the sofa. You'll need to work through the exercises, try what he's demonstrating for yourself.

Take it slowly and don't forget to pop the DVD into your computer to access the printable lesson notes, including printable versions of the cubes and value scale.There's a tremendous amount of information packed in here, providing a solid foundation in color knowledge. If you're teaching yourself to paint or have some experience but struggle with color, this DVD will provide the equivalent of an intensive Color Theory 101 class.
