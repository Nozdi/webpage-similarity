We don't drink in our household but we do use liqueur for cooking, so I used this Scoops raspberry torte ice cream Liqueur bottle and the last green apple. I found it difficult to find a table with enough light to make enough shadow but still seemed to find a little and a small shimmer on the bottle.

I used watercolor and made sort of a mess of my bottle and apple. It doesn't look real. I used a light blue sheet to put my still life on and the folds didn't turn out like I wanted. I plan on painting another still life with more light and on a glass table to see if I can capture the light and colors better.
