Honeysuckle by Vicki. I used acrylic on an 8 x 10" canvas board. I used Van Dycke brown, yellow ochre, pyrrole crimson, Hookers green, cadmium yellow, and titanium white and I mixed on canvas.

I started painting close ups of complicated flowers because they seem to be from another world when painting so close up. But I also paint soft delicate flowers that can be blended like Georgia O'Keef does. I bought several flower books to paint from photos and I have also picked out several flowers from Michaels in order to arrange a still life setting with a vase and some times fruit.

One of the "secrets" to painting something with as intricate a structure as honeysuckle is granting yourself permission to spend the time, not expecting to complete it in the same time as a simpler and more familiar flower structure such as a daisy. Don't give up on the honeysuckle, but build on what you learnt painting this one!
