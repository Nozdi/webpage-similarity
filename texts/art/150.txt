Question: Where can you find tools to draw a simple floor plan?

A new homeowner writes that she would like to draw a simple floor plan to help with remodeling and decorating projects.

"I figured I could find some simple tools on the web, but all I can find is software intended for 3-D design," she says. "Most do not make drawing to some scale or designating distance easily."

Are there simple online tools to help draw floor plans?
