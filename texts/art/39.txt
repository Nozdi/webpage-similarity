Your clues this week are:Please email me your guesses over the coming week. I'll post the winner and correct answer with next week's guessing game. Good luck! The clues involved American painter James Carroll Beckwith (1852-1917) and his portrait of William Martin "Buck" Walton (1832-1915), Confederate Army Major and Attorney General of Texas. Rita K. knew both answers, and her email came in before the other correct entries. Rita, I never see your name without humming a certain tune from Sgt. Pepper's -- I'll bet you hear that a lot, don't you? Congratulations, lovely Rita, and many thanks to all who played!
