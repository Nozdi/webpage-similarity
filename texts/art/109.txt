Flowers are always a challenge for me and I thought if I could paint one in a kind of abstract way would it look like one!

I had a composition in mind before I began and it evolved as I went along to look just like I wanted. It was kind of interesting painting it and I used a retarder medium to make the paints stay wet longer and to get the paints to kind of "smooge" together which helped a lot, but then it muted the colors rather than making them bright and vibrant which I would have preferred.

I'm hoping the flower is recognized for what it is suppose to be!
