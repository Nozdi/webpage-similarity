What or who fired your passion for art history? 

 Writing, travel, and art are an inseparable combination. Working on a PhD in art history has enabled me to incorporate all of these into my career.

Have you run into any negatives while doing this? 

 Too much advice for bloggers focuses on site traffic and marketing instead of good writing or thought-provoking dialogue.

What about art history blogging fulfills you? 

 It is an outlet for ideas about art and the middle ages that incorporates my academic research into my interaction with a more general audience. Pondering art (from any place or time) ultimately helps us decipher with what it means to be human.



 Kudos for the thoughtful posts you write, Ms. McMichael, and best of luck with your PhD. Medieval art history is fascinating, but is all too often relegated to the back shelf. It definitely needs your voice to keep it alive in readers' imaginations.
