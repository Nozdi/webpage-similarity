Actually I started a blog just months ago, but I cover history in the making ... mostly people and events I've attended.

It allows me to promote something I love, and select my subjects. I think art is fascinating and want to make others aware of it too.

I have promoted artists for years but recently have reached into Social Media on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and now Blog. This phenomenon which we are encountering is making history. I read recently that Twitter entered all it's tweets into the Library of Congress.

Willie Nelson was just quoted in The Parade as saying "I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times." If that is true, then the arts are going to explode. I want to be there when they do!
