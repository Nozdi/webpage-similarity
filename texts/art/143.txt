Snohetta is an international group of architects, landscape architects, and interior designers with offices in Oslo, Norway and New york City. The firm was founded in 1989 by architects from Norway and Los Angeles. They named the firm Snohetta after a large mountain in Norway. Since its beginnings, Snohetta Arkitektur-Landskap has envisioned building and design as an interconnected, holistic venture. The firm is best-known in the U.S. for the only above-ground structure at Ground Zero in NYC.

In 2012, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) honored Dykers, Thorsen, and Liz Burow as Architects of Healing.

As much as Snohetta wants their clients to think like architects, the partnership also is committed to thinking like their clients. Sustainability is both social and environmental. "Trends are routinely ignored and essence is actively pursued," they say on their website. The Snohetta approach of transpositioning is a way of doing things that crosses disciplines, "from architects to visual artists, philosophers to sociologists," encourages interconnections, and dismisses narrow thinking.

Snohetta has won many high-profile competitions (e.g., the 9/11 Memorial Museum Atrium Pavilion), which exemplify their philosophy and approach to design and building. Integrating architecture and landscape is also seen in smaller projects, like the 2012 hunting lodge at Akrafjorden built for Osvald M. Bjelland in Norway.
