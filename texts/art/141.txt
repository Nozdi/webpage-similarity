Can architecture really heal?When I visited Lower Manhattan last fall, I peeked through the atrium window of the National September 11 Memorial Museum and was awed by the sight of the the two steel tridents salvaged from the destroyed Twin Towers. The entryway Pavilion designed by Snohetta and the Davis Brody Bond-designed underground Museum display the architectural salvage from the terrorist attacks.

But last year, as I gawked like a deer in the headlights at the massive steel beams and stairs leading downward toward the bedrock, it wasn't really awe I felt. It was an uneasiness. I'm not sure I'm ready for the museum and the memories it holds. But there it is.
