Your clues this week are:Please email me your guesses over the coming week. I'll post the winner and correct answer with next week's guessing game. Good luck!I tried to paint a picture (ha! ... see what I did there?) with the clues , hoping everyone would immediately say, "Oh, she's writing about Vilhelm Hammershoi, the Danish artist who lived from 1864 to 1916. And, yes, the light does slant that way in Copenhagen." We were looking at his 1901 Interior with Piano and Woman in Black. By the way, "Woman" was his wife, Ida, the sister of his lifelong male friend, business partner and colleague Peter Ilsted. (Why Vilhelm almost always showed Ida's back is a mystery to me.) Jacobiene in The Netherlands knew the correct answer about one minute before Alison in Zimbabwe, so congratulations to both of you Early Birds. No, wait. You're not early. There are such things as time zones ... anyhow, thank you Jacobiene, Alison and all who participated!
