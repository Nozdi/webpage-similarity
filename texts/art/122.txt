See what you get when you mix a particular red, orange, yellow, etc, with colours in a standard palette, in a variety of mediums. It'll save you a lot of time and paint.

With so many colours available, who's got the time to mix them all to find out exactly what you get? But we've also all had times when we just haven't got the right manufactured colour. Enter the Colour Mixing Bible, which has done it for you, in a variety of mediums. For each, except inks and pencils, a basic palette of 11 colours is mixed with six reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, violets, browns, blacks and greys, and white. Inks are mixed with one or two colours and pencils with four. Introductory chapters look at the science of colour and colour theory. It's an indispensable visual directory destined to be spattered with paint as it lies open next to you as you work. With time you'll find you internalise the information, but until then it'll help save paint. (If you do have any mixes that go wrong, scrape it together into an airtight jar and you'll find it'll produce an interesting gray.)
