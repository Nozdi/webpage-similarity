If you read this book from cover to cover, taking one section a week, it'll take you about 40 weeks. So no wonder I think it's like taking an Art 101 course. It's aimed at people who want to know more about how paintings work, what makes a good painting and a bad, what goes into making a painting and particular styles and subjects. The way it's organized means you can pick it up as time permits to dip into a section, or you could read it from cover to cover. It's a book that will not only give you knowledge that'll help you get more out of viewing other people's paintings, but will also help you with developing your own painting.
