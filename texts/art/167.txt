Why is this book about Frank Lloyd Wright's love life fiction? The narrator, Tadashi Sato, is a character created by the author, although Wright's women--Olgivanna, Miriam and Mamah--are real characters. Calling the work fiction allows author Boyle to create points of view based in reality, but not wedded to fact-checking. The freedom to explore reality through fiction gives Wright's turbulent life and character a different context. Boyle says, "It is my hope that the reader will not only enjoy the ride--there is humor abounding here, as well as disturbance and horror (always a splendid mix, at least from my point of view)--but come to appreciate more deeply the character and career of the architect as well." T. Coraghessan Boyle lives in a Wright-designed house in California.
