This painting was inspired by the 26th annual Chrysanthemums show held in our city. I love painting flowers, so this idea was welcome. There was limitless possibilities - big flowers, small flowers, so many colours. The reference photograph of this flower indicated painterly possibilities.

After making the sketch, I used oil pastels for highlights and then painted the flower.
