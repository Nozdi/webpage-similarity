I was daydreaming about different ways of composing this still life, when I thought of this one. I thought it was humorous that the little grape was still hanging on its vine while it's big brother, the wine, was all finished. I worked on the bottom of the wine bottle a lot trying to get it round, I finally just left it alone. By contrast, the grape on the vine was quick, easy and fun.

When I set up the project, I wondered how many people might think to lie the bottle down, to give a different angle. Our instinct is to place a bottle standing up, because that's how we use it. But on its side, a bottle presents all sorts of interesting options, and I think your painting is likely to inspire people to think again about the composition possibilities. It's a still life that immediately stands out from the crowd.

The shadow on the left doesn't bother me, it gives a sense of the scene continuing on that side, that if I turned my head I might see another grape or bottle.
