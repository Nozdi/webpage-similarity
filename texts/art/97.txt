Any painter interested in knowing more about the colours they use and the way colours were discovered, developed, or evolved, will find this book fascinating.

'Bright Earth' is a fascinating history of the use of pigments in Western art, including the discovery and development of pigments, the way they were used by particular artists and in specific eras, for example Impressionism. It's history writing at its best -- compelling reading, packed with examples, anecdotes, and quotes, and leaves you with a new appreciation for colour. Occasional it's a bit technical if chemistry isn't your strong point, but skipping these won't detract from your enjoyment of the book. Any painter wanting to know more about the colours that we today simply squeeze from a tube, or an art lover wanting to get a new level of appreciation for masterworks in gallery, is sure to enjoy this book.
