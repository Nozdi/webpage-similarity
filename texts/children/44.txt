To err is human, and to make discipline mistakes is sometimes a part of being a parent. The next time your child misbehaves and you find yourself losing your cool or wondering if you are handling your child's bad behavior the right way, think about these solutions to fixing common discipline mistakes that parents often make.

And remember to give yourself a break: These mistakes are common because we have all made one or more of these at one time or another. In other words, we have all been there and you are not the only one. Remind yourself of the advice you might give your child: Mistakes are what we learn from so that we can grow.
