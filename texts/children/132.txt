I remember years ago starting around the time my son was 5 years old - also the time he started school.  I was told more than once that I needed to have my son "tested" because he had ADHD.  (He was evaluated, and he didn't and doesn't have it.)

Once when I was checking out some books at the university library, a patron was discussing giftedness and ADHD with the librarian, who said, "Giftedness and ADHD go hand-in-hand. That's right.  The librarian was telling the patron that if a child is gifted, he most likely has ADHD.  I jumped in to set the record straight.

That was nearly 20 years ago and I, along with others, still have to jump in to set the record straight on giftedness and ADHD.  Laura Ungar, of the Louisville Courier-Journal, just wrote about this same issue a few days ago in her article, "Is it ADHD or giftedness?" She was just introduced to the issue herself, and to her credit, she wrote about it.

As Ungar points out, doctors aren't generally educated about giftedness nor does the topic often come up in pediatric journal articles. I would add that in general most teachers don't get much instruction on giftedness in their education studies.  If they do, it is usually a very small part of instruction on all special needs students. It's not surprising, then, that we still have to jump in to set the record straight.

In fairness, it can be difficult to distinguish between ADHD and giftedness since the characteristics are similar.  But really... after so many years, shouldn't we have more understanding of giftedness than we do?
