I asked the folks at the Maryland Coalition for Inclusive Education what makes this resource special, and they wrote: "MCIE is a GREAT organization! It is the ONLY organization in the United States that has the inclusion of students with disabilities as its primary focus, and also provides both advocacy services for families and professional development services to schools. Our staff are experts in their fields; our Directors are involved in national and international work to promote inclusion." Scroll down for more on the Maryland Coalition for Inclusive Education.

On the Readers Respond page for the Maryland Coalition for Inclusive Education, reader catriona wrote, "I no longer live in Maryland, but I lived there for many years and was supported by MCIE in so many ways. I attended their workshops and conferences, read their booklets and newsletters, and was lucky enough to watch both the professional development and advocacy sides of the organization at work. They literally have changed individual children's lives both through their advocacy with schools for inclusive education and the work they do with school systems to increase teacher skills and schools' capacity for inclusion of students with diverse abilities. Maryland's education system would not be where it is today were it not for MCIE and many children would still be receiving substandard educations in segregated classrooms and schools if MCIE had not become involved with their families."
