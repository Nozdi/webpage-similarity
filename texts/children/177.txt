A baby's brain is hardwired to learn a language. That means that a baby doesn't need to be taught how to speak a language; it happens naturally. Babies learn language pretty much from the moment they are born. It's an amazingly complex skill, but since it's natural, we aren't aware of everything it involves. Unlike learning language, though, learning to read is not natural. It has to be taught. And as complex as language is, reading is even more complex. So what exactly is necessary?

Like learning language, learning to read occurs in stages. Although not everyone agrees on exactly how those stages progress, knowing what the stages are can provide you with an idea on how children come to break the written code and learn to read.

Once children can recognize enough words relatively quickly and easily, they are ready to move from reading individual words to reading sentences and then paragraphs. At that point, they can start to focus on comprehending what they are reading. Most children reach this stage sometime during third grade.
