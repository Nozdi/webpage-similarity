This book is definitely going to help gifted kids realize that they are not alone. There are seven different chapters, each on a topic of interest: giftedness, fitting in, expectations, school, home, passions, and looking ahead. Each chapter is organized around specific questions like "What do you think being gifted means?" "Do you ever wish you were NOT gifted?" "Are there ever times when you try to hide the fact that you are gifted?" "How do others react when you make a mistake?" "Do you ever get bored in school?" and many, many more. The answers to the questions are responses from kids aged 4 to 12. Any child who feels he or she is alone will recognize themselves in some of these responses from other kids and know that they are not truly alone. Ages 4 and up
