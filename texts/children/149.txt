Definition: Term refers to those who are gifted and have a disability or are gifted and have ADHD. Although the disability can be a physical disability such as a hearing impairment, it is most commonly used in reference to a learning disability such as dyslexia. Children with dual exceptionalities are difficult to identify because their strengths from their giftedness hide their weaknesses from their disability. This means that their giftedness hides their giftedness and their giftedness hides their disability. Consequently, they appear to be average children. When they are not properly identified, they do not get the appropriate services they need for either their disability or their giftedness.

Also Known As: Gifted and LD. Children are sometimes referred to as "crossover children."
