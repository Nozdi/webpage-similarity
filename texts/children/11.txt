I asked Barb Dittrich of Snappin' Ministries if she had a message for the fans who helped Snappin' Ministries to a very close second-place finish in the Favorite Special-Needs Regional Resource category, and she wrote:



 "Our goal at SNAPPIN' MINISTRIES permeates everything we do, including the About.com contest. That goal is to share a hope with parents of children who have special needs that goes far beyond a cure or improved circumstances. This is a hope that exceeds the ability of one person. In other words, our support of parents is only possible through the encouragement and support of people just like you. We are tremendously honored to have you share our commitment and vision for supporting these caregiving parents who are so under-served. Thank you for voting for us in this contest! Now go tell others about our mission and work."



 About Snappin' Ministries: "Snappin' Ministries is unique in that our core competency is in supporting the parents of children with special needs. We believe that the health of the family begins with the health of the parents. Moms and dads need support, resources and encouragement in raising these remarkable children, and that's exactly what we provide."
