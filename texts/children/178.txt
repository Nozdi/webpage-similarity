I just read an article by Stephen Mason inand I admit some of it made me uncomfortable. While I can't say I disagree with much of what Mason said, there is something about the way he said it -- bluntly.The article, Their Kids Are Smarter than Our Kids , discusses the attitudes Americans have toward high IQ 's. Mason's view is not terribly flattering. He thinks the average American is essentially clueless on the meaning of intelligence and it's this lack of understanding that leads to the dumbing down of American kids and their poor achievement compared to kids in other industrialized nations.Among other things, Mason says that "Americans are far more likely to support remedial classes for dumb kids than they are to provide gifted offerings for smart kids. Naturally, a lot of dumb adults will take offense at that last statement...and then wonder why we don't have a cure for cancer?"Now that's blunt.  Maybe it's beyond blunt.  But is it essentially untrue?
