Message from the Editors: "Kids with autism are kids first and they do learn and grow and change, and so do we as we parent them. Cultivate awareness, curiosity, a more careful seeing, a willingness to be surprised, and above all, the need to honor and respect the individual. With all the misconceptions surrounding autism, it feels important to open up a dialogue and talk about what is and isn't true about autistic children, how parents of autistic kids feel and don't feel, and what their days and lives are like. We hope this book is a way to begin that conversation."
