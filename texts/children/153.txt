A little lawyer is a verbally gifted child who is good at using logic to argue for or against a position. Because they are so good at it, their parents may have a hard time saying "no" to them and making it stick. They can logically explain why they should be allowed to do what they've asked to do, whether it's having a friend over on a school night, getting a cookie before dinner, or staying up past bedtime.A little lawyer can also find and exploit any loophole in any rule a parent has set, logically explaining what the loophole is and how it should prevent him or her from having to suffer the consequences of breaking that rule.Little lawyers can be quite manipulative and parents need to take care that they don't give up control to their children. Gifted children, even these little lawyers, need guidance.Parents can maintain control by refusing to get caught up in the arguing. They simply need to learn How (Not) to Argue with Gifted Children
