Definition: A self-taught reader is a child who has "broken the code" of reading without any formal reading instruction. The code is the alphabet as a symbol system of sounds and words. A child first realizes that letters represent sounds and that together letters represent words. Self-taught readers figure out this symbol system on their own, sometimes with little more to go on than a videotape about the alphabet or simply being read to frequently.



 Some self-taught readers may not enjoy being read to until they have started to break the code. That is, they realize that letters on a page represent language and then they want to be read to in order to learn more about that symbol system. These children may ask whoever is reading to them to point to words as they are being read, or if they aren't yet talking, may grab the reader's finger and move it to each word as it's being read.
