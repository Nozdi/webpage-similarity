It's easy to see why Rainbow Loom bracelets are super-popular with school-age kids. They are colorful, fun to make, and look absolutely awesome when worn together in a bunch or one at a time. And because they're made of stretchy rubber, then can be easily removed and put back on, and kids don't have to worry about getting them wet. It's the perfect combination of craft and jewelry for kids.

These fishtail bracelets can be made with or without a full-size Rainbow Loom. Here are some easy step-by-step instructions for how to make a rubberband fishtail bracelet using a mini Rainbow Loom. If you are using a full-size loom, you can simply use any two pegs instead of the mini loom.

Kids can make this Rainbow Loom fishtail bracelet with alternating colors or group colors together to form a rainbow or other design pattern. Encourage them to use their imagination to make their own designs!
