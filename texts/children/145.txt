Hyperlexia is a syndrome characterized by an intense fascination with letters or numbers and an advanced reading ability. Hyperlexic children read at levels far beyond those of their age mates and often begin reading at very young ages, sometimes at age two.This advanced reading ability is in contrast with difficulties understanding spoken language.

Instead hyperlexic children memorize phrases, sentences or entire conversations. To express an idea, the children must be able to dissect what they have memorized to create original expressions.Hyperlexic children have excellent visual and auditory memories, which means they easily remember what they see and hear.
