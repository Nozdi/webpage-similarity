How do you choose which new and recently-released kids' movies to see, either in the theaters or for viewing at home? Gone are the days when seeing a family film meant choosing between Snow White and Bambi. Today, there are more new kids' movies choices than ever before, and many of these releases are more visually sophisticated, complex, witty, and lyrical enough to be entertaining for grown-ups (Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and the Toy Story series, to name just a few).

And because kids' movies can rake in big bucks, they're a big business. Whether you and your kids love action, adventure, or comedy, you're sure to find lots of new and recently-released family movies in theaters and out on DVD (or for downloading at home) on any given month.

With so many choices, though, the challenge becomes how to choose what is appropriate for your child, not to mention worth seeing (just because a film is rated "G," it doesn't automatically mean it's a good movie that's worth your child's time -- and yours). Then there is the fact that ratings simply do not provide enough information. Some "G" rated films may contain violence while a "PG" film might be fine for a grade-school age child.

If you are a parent seeking information about the content of new kids' films, here are some great strategies that can help you make an educated decision.
