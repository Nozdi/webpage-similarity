I'll Tell You Why ... I Can't Wear Those Clothes was a 2012 finalist for Favorite Special-Needs Children's Book. For her expert recommendation, author Noreen O'Sullivan "would like to draw attention to a few holistic health blogs -- Whole New Mom  is one that comes to mind as well as Mind Body Green, which I recommend for the parents. As I always say, 'Oxygen mask to the mom first.' I think we all tend to forget this as we try so hard to help our children; sometimes we need to make sure we have enough oxygen to keep up, so a blog that helps the parent stay balanced is also important. Surely my all time favorite is SPD Connect, where Teresa leads parents into making holistic conclusions among themselves.

"Of course, I am also very fond of my own Facebook page. My page is a bit more straightforward than SPD Connect -- I tend to specifically lead parents to explore intestinal health, positive psychology, and adequate exercise as I continue to work with parents and children and see dramatic changes in behavior based on dietary changes. I am amazed at how the interactions continue to be supportive and nonjudgmental of others' opinions, and as of yet I have never had to delete an inappropriate post.

 These days, I think that is special."
