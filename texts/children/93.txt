I recently read a disturbing article on LiveScience about kids as young as elementary school age consuming energy drinks. According to the article, young children are downing these highly-caffeinated drinks as well as experimenting with caffeine strips to feel a buzz. As a result, many are ending up in school nurses' offices with heart palpitations. Even more scary, too much caffeine in younger children, who have smaller bodies, can lead to seizures, strokes, and even death.

The health risks go beyond heart palpitations: Energy drinks are cited by experts as being a "gateway drug," meaning kids who use energy drinks are at increased risk of becoming dependent on alcohol or drinking heavily.

So if you see any of your child's friends--or your own child--sipping an energy drink, step in immediately. Explain the risks and tell them why these drinks and other caffeinated beverages are dangerous for kids, and why they should always just say no.
