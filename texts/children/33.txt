Kidneys and Eyes is written by Julia Roberts. I asked Julia to tell us what's special about her blog, and she wrote: "I started Kidneys and Eyes nearly eight years ago as a way of keeping family informed of the impending kidney failure of both my kids and to update them on the progress the kids were making with their developmental struggles. It turned into so much more: therapy, connection point to other parents, life-saving connection about mental health, educational tool for educators and health professionals and eventually Support for Special Needs.com, a social network for special needs families [and a nominee for Favorite Special-Needs Online Community]. I like to think it's honest, raw, and funny. I love that people reach out and tell me their stories, I love that they know they're not alone. I love to know that I'm not alone."
