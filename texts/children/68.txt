Try these other school lunch ideas from Amy Jamieson-Petonic, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Recipes are included.

For packed school lunches, you can stuff the turkey and cheese into the pita bread and pack the tomatoes and olives separately on the side. Add a cup of fat-free or 1 percent milk.

At home, you can arrange the vegetables into a happy face on the pita using the banana sliced in half lengthwise as the eyebrows, the cherry tomatoes for the nose, and the olives for the eyes.

Cook the pasta and drain. Add the red bell pepper and shredded carrots. Stir in the chicken pieces. Then, mix in the Italian dressing or olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

Add a small apple and one cup of fat-free or 1 percent milk.
