I asked the folks at NJAPE.org what makes this resource special, and they wrote: "We believe that New Jersey All People Equal (NJAPE) is unique in that we provide vital services to individuals with special needs, their families, and the professionals who serve them, with the skills and training that promote meaningful and inclusive recreational, phyisical, and wellness experiences in their local community. Our services are founded upon both a best-practices model, and a belief that all individuals are equal no matter their abilities. Our foundational principal is that far too often, local programs are designed for individuals who possess the highest skill level, rather than the majority of individuals who possess moderate to emergent skills."
