I know I just wrote about my son leaving for boot camp, but that might explain my current fixation on the military. My son and I have an exceptionally good relationship. We've always shared ideas and activities and we have always been able to talk. Always. My son often came to me with some new idea or something he'd learned... "Mom, know what?" Even when he went away to college, I'd get phone calls that started with "Mom, guess what?" In boot camp, recruits don't get to call mom and dad. I won't get to hear "Mom, know what?" for ten full weeks. I can get letters, but they won't be the same as that excited "Mom, guess what?" So, for the next ten weeks, I'm going to have a once-a-week feature on gifted kids in the military and in history. My son was moved to join the National Guard for a number of reasons, one of which was its history. He absolutely loved the fact that it was founded in 1636 and was part of the American Revolution. Not all gifted kids want to be part of the military, but some do. My focus on the military will not be to convince anyone to join or encourage their child to join the military, but to support those who do make that choice. Bear with me. I have an aching heart right now.
