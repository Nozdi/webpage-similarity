World Oceans Day is a while away - June 8th. But it's not too early to think about it since there is a photo contest!  Yes, that's right. A photo contest. If your child loves the oceans and photography, this is a great opportunity.

Contestants can enter photos into one of five categories, the last one being open to kids  under the age of 16 (as of April 1, 2014). The categories are as follows:

Adults (and kids over 16) can enter a photo in the other 4 categories. For more information, check out the World Oceans Day Photo Contest page.

If your child loves the ocean, but isn't ready or able to take photos for this competition, give her some books to read about the ocean and all the forms of life within it. Many of these books contain beautiful photographs.
