Message from the Author: Noreen says she created this book to offer "short, simple understanding for children with tactile sensitivity. Intended to be read with your child, this book explains the physical reasons your child may become emotionally overwhelmed by daily routines such as putting on shoes, clothing and bathing. The special inclusion of a drawing journal allows your child to express their individual needs using their own language/pictures. Hand it to family, babysitters, teachers and friends and have your child's misunderstood behavior finally understood in minutes."
