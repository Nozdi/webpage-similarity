What annoys Americans the most? One of the top items on the list has to do with out-of-control kids, according to a new Harris Poll. The poll, which surveyed over 2,200 adults, found that as many as 87 percent people said they can't stand it when parents let their kids run amok or be disruptive in public places.

To put it in perspective, that's even more than the number of people who are irked by fellow airplane passengers who misuse overhead bins by, say, taking up all the storage space or using bins that aren't near where they're sitting (65 percent) or the number of people who are irritated by those who talk loudly on their cellphones in public places (65 percent).

I gotta admit that I find it appalling when parents don't discipline their kids. Sure, every child has a tantrum now and then, and even the nicest kids can have an off day or cranky moments. (Hey, kids, like adults, are only human.) But when parents don't discipline at all, and don't even make a move to calm or quiet a child who's having a full-blown meltdown that is loud enough to set off car alarms, then it's just downright inconsiderate. Just another reminder why we should discipline kids---not only for the sake of anyone nearby but for the good of your own child as well. Disciplining kids not only makes other people around you happier, but research shows that it can make kids happier, too.
