A new film called Fed Up, produced by Katie Couric and Laurie David (who produced An Inconvenient Truth), is taking on big sugar--that is, food companies that are loading up seemingly healthy foods like corn flakes with sugar.

The film points out that as much as 80 percent of food items in America contain added sugar, which is highly addictive. What that means for consumers is rising rates of obesity and illnesses like diabetes, even in children.

I haven't seen the film yet but I definitely plan to. This is an important issue for all parents since our children are the ones whose eating habits and palates have become modified to want sugar in increasing amounts. As experts in the film's trailer point out, getting kids to exercise is not enough. We need to really look at what they are eating, and what ingredients are on those labels when we pick up something that looks innocent like a box of whole-grain, low-fat crackers. (Yep, chances are it will be loaded with sugar.)
