No, I don't really mean gifted kids are destructive. Maybe a better word to use would be deconstructive.  If you have one of these gifted kids, you know what I'm talking about.

Deconstructive gifted kids are the kids who have to take everything apart. They have an intense curiosity about how things work and to find out, they take things apart. How does that CD player work? Maybe if I take all those screws out, I'll figure it out.

It doesn't always matter what the object is - as long as it has parts and does something, it's fair game for being taken apart.  Parents often try to discourage this behavior. It does, after all, start getting expensive to replace all those deconstructed items. But I say, encourage it! You never know what your child will learn or where that curiosity will take him. There are some guidelines, however, since you want your child to be safe. Other than that, let the fun begin!
