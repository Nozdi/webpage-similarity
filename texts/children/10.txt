Message from the Author: "I think The Bravest Boy I Ever Knew is special because it is about a regular boy talking about his best friend who is disabled. Michael, who tells the story, shows the reader that his best friend can do things like him. He just has to do it his own way. Michael also talks about the problems his friend experiences and how he deals with them. This book doesn't show the bad things about having a disability. It shows how a person deals with their disability by making the most of every day."

Excerpt from The Bravest Boy I Ever Knew: Lisa says her favorite passage is when Michael says of his friend: "He never worries what others think of him. He's not like any other friend I've ever had."
