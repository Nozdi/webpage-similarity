One of the remarks I hear all the time is "Every parent wants their kid to be gifted."  I suspect that the reasoning behind this remark is that parents who claim their children are gifted are just saying that in order to get praise they don't deserve. In other words, they want people to think they are special because their children are somehow special.

When parents are expecting a child, they may hope for a gifted child, but in this case, what they are really hoping for is a child who does well in school and will be successful in life.

In both cases -- people saying that "every parent wants their kid to be gifted" and expectant parents hoping their child is gifted -- the people involved don't understand what giftedness is or what it is like to be the parent of a gifted child. As the parent of a gifted child, I can assure you that while I hoped for a healthy, happy, and successful child, I certainly didn't hope to have to fight with teachers and schools to get them to accommodate my child's academic needs, and I definitely didn't hope to get snide remarks from other parents and a complete lack of empathy.

So do all parents want a gifted kid? Some parents *think* that's what they want - before their child is born, but no parent wants a complicated life. We all want the same thing: a happy, healthy, successful child. But we also love the child we have. My life as the parent of a gifted child has been a roller coaster ride, but it's also been a fun and exciting adventure.

Most parents of gifted children just roll their eyes at that remark (even if they politely do it in their heads).
