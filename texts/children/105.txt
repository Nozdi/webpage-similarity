School bullying is an unfortunate reality in many kids' lives. It's important to talk to your child before the new school year and periodically throughout the next several months about bullying (what it is, whether or not if she's ever witnessed any verbal or physical aggression among kids of if she's ever had anyone bully her, for example).

Making sure your child is prepared to spot the signs of bullying and knows what to do if it happens is an important part of getting ready for back to school.
