We all want what is best for our children. We guide them as best we can to help them develop and make good life choices. It's not always easy, though, because we can sometimes let our own interests and desires cloud our judgment. In other words, we guide our children toward goals that we like rather than goals based on our children's abilities and interests. One career that many parents steer their children away from is a military one. Is a military career right for your son or daughter?Some of the reasons a military career might be a good choice for gifted kids are based on some of common traits we see in gifted kids, but other reasons apply to everyone.No parent wishes to see her child put in harm's way. We want our children to be safe. However, some of our children grow up and become those who help to keep others safe. It's not a career for everyone, but it can be excellent option for many gifted children. Is your child one of them?
