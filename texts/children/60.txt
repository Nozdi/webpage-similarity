As much as we might like to think that our children will always tell the truth, the reality is that lying is something most children experiment with at one point or another. Parents should keep in mind that telling lies is a natural part of child development, and that in most cases, children outgrow this behavior.

When addressing this common problem, parents should consider a child's age, the circumstances and reasons for the lie, and how frequently he engages in this behavior. For example, many younger children -- usually younger than age 6 -- cannot yet make a clear distinction between fantasy and reality, and their "lie" may actually just be an expression of their imagination. That said, a child as young as age 4 is perfectly capable of deliberately telling a lie to, say, avoid getting into trouble or get something he wants.
