This book allows children to engage in activities and conduct experiments that help them learn about a variety of oceanic principles: waves and currents, shorelines and tide pools, the ocean floor, marine life, and ocean conservation. The experiments are neither too hard nor too easy and can be done using materials that are readily available. It's a great book for all kids, but homeschooling parents will find it especially useful, as it can be used for study in ecology, math, biology, social studies, and art. Some readers might be bothered by what some might consider "global-warming propaganda." Anyone bothered by it can easily ignore it. It's not a book to pass up just for that reason.
