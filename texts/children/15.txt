Fun and Function was founded by Aviva Weiss, who has this message for fans who pushed Fun and Function into the lead: "Families with special needs don't feel alone on our Facebook page because 11,000 people stand by with helpful ideas, useful information, and kind words of support. Each day, I am moved by the collective will to listen, empathize, and coach one another through the challenges, without losing sight of the incredible potential of each child. When our Facebook page was nominated for this award, our community responded with an outpouring of appreciation and votes -- as many as 1,500 in one day! I want to express my heartfelt gratitude and commitment to be an inspiring place for all our Friends. You're invited to join the conversation right now, at http://www.facebook.com/FunandFunctionFans."

I asked Aviva to tell us what's special about Fun and Function, and she wrote, "Your kids may have special needs, but there are also lots of practical questions that you face day-to-day. How do you get your child with sensory issues to try new foods? What are the best tricks to teach social skills to kids who struggle with them? How do you transition your special needs kids into their teens and adulthood? At the Fun and Function Facebook page you will find a community 10,000+ strong of parents committed to helping each other through the obstacle course of childhood. Share your perspective and be inspired by the wisdom and courage of others. Thanks to all of you for contributing to our wonderful community!"
