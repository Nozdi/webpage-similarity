Question: At what age can one determine whether a child is gifted?

I am just curious at what age can one determine whether a child is gifted. My daughter, at age 7 months, is an agile crawler, pulls herself to standing, can "cruise" for short distances and waves bye-bye. She can pick up cheerios with her thumb and finger. She is extremely active and curious. Is it possible to tell at such an early age whether a child is truly gifted?

Answer: It is possible to tell if a child is gifted at very young ages, sometimes as young as infancy. 



 Giftedness can also be seen in toddlers.

Some studies suggest that the need for stimulation can be seen in gifted babies Giftedness can also be seen in toddlers. Characteristics of young gifted children include high energy levels and intense curiosity. Gifted children also tend to reach developmental milestones earlier than other children. That means they may be walking and talking earlier than other children. However, not all gifted children reach all milestones early. In fact, sometimes they may appear to be behind. For example, some gifted children don't begin talking until after they turn two.If you know what to look for, you can determine quite early that a child is gifted.
