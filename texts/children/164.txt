My week started out in a tough way. At 5 a.m. Monday morning, my son left for boot camp. I won't see him now for at least ten weeks, when he's done with basic training. He'll be able to write letters home, but that's it. No visits and few phone calls.

I've been thinking about how I feel about my son joining the National Guard and going off to boot camp. A friend of mine sent me a copy of a letter from a soldier in Afghanistan that was posted on the National Review Online (NRO). Here's my favorite part:

"We are not your sons and daughters, whom you must protect and defend. We are your sword and your shield. We are men and women who volunteer to place our lives on the line so you do not have to. We do not decide when or where we will be sent. We go. You are our advocates, not our parents."

This sums up part of the difficulty I have as the parent of a newly enlisted soldier. I've spent over twenty years raising my son, protecting and defending him. Even though he is now twenty years old, I still feel that is my role as a parent. We are, after all, always a parent. We will always worry about our children, no matter how old they are. It is very difficult to adjust to the idea that my son is now in the role of being the protector and defender, and not just of me, but of our entire country, and if you want to extend it, of freedom itself.

I look at my son and still see the kid who hates to do homework and can't keep his room clean. And now he's part of our sword and shield. I can't be the only parent who has a tough time with this transition. Until I read that soldier's letter, I don't think I understood my feelings. They are quite a mix. I'm proud of him, but I'm also apprehensive.

At this stage, though, my apprehension is not a concern about his new role as soldier and protector.  I'm just hoping he makes it through boot camp!
