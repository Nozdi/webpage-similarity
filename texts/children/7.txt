Message from the Author: "I'm a mom, educator, and author, and this new book is my wisdom and love offering to help parents who walk the path I have walked with my son Jonathan for the last 27 years. It is a book full of information, humor, and tons of practical advice. It is intended to do exactly what the subtitle says: make your life easier. And richer. I wrote the book as if I were sitting face to face over a mocha latte with each of my readers. It's straight from my heart and brain to yours. I offer you insight, laughter, and comfort -- not to mention advice that actually works. I show you a view of our children with Down syndrome as the amazingly perceptive teachers (and sometimes crazy-making individuals) that they really are, and how to keep the journey beautiful."
