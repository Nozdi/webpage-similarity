The preschool I found for my son was as perfect as a preschool could possibly be. It was housed in what was once a small house, and although there were a couple of rooms and a kitchen, it was run much like a one-room schoolhouse. Kids were not divided into different classes based on age and they were free to associate with any of the other kids. That was perfect for my little gifted three-year-old, who soon became the favorite playmate of kids of all ages, from his fellow three-year-olds to the ten-year-olds who attended the school on days when they had a day off from their regular school.

Every child in that school was loved and challenged. Every child was encouraged to learn and explore.  When the teacher discovered that my son could read, she let him read to the rest of the children during "story time." There was no issue of unfairness because the other children couldn't read, nor did the other children resent my son.  On the contrary.  During free times, some of them sought him out and asked him to read to them.  There was no resentment because no child was ever left out; every child was given a chance to shine and feel proud.

My son loved that school and loved the teacher, Mrs. Marovich. She was the rare teacher who makes good teaching look effortless. It was Mrs. Marovich who first introduced me to the idea of gifted children.

Did your child ever have an exceptionally good school experience?  If so, give the school and teacher some well-deserved praise.  Share your story in a comment!
