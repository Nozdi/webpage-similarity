When the weather gets warm, kids love to get wet. But water play can be a problem for kids with special needs. Ear tubes and hearing aids need to stay dry. Swim diapers can be hard to find for older kids. And children who can't swim due to physical disabilities or poor motor skills are at risk. Fortunately, there are products that can help keep special kids in the swim.
