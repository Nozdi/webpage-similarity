Community: Support for Special Needs

 Venue: Website

 Finalist for: Best Special-Needs Online Community



A message from Dawn Friedman, co-founder and managing editor: "We wanted to make a site where anyone parenting a child with special needs would feel welcomed. We deliberately built a community that would unite people because we know that we all tend to group via diagnosis and we felt like it was important to welcome the wisdom that every parent has. After all, a mom whose child has autism might have some great IEP insight that would benefit a mom whose child has a limb difference. So we really focus on what unites us instead of what divides us. We also work hard to make our site fun and to bring benefits to the community (like our holiday Great Big Wish List Giveaway where we gave away over 70 toys and gifts!). This year we're all about creating off-line connections so that our members have more than a virtual community to lean on."
