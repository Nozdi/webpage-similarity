Many people have asked what the prize or reward might be. I have answered with this: The prize is knowing that we reached so many people who may not have come across eSpecially Ben if not for this contest. The reward is feeling supported by a loving and caring community of family, friends and strangers who made the choice to get involved and vote -- THANK YOU!"

I asked Vanessa to tell us what's special about her blog, and she wrote: "When I started to write at eSpecially Ben, my intention was to help other families who may be experiencing similar situations while raising a child with special needs. To my surprise, the site has grown to a place where I learn along with my readers as new issues develop. While relying on my inspiration, our son Ben, I take one day at a time. eSpecially Ben tries to show all the sides of parenting a child with special needs - some posts make readers cry, laugh and on a really good day, think."
