If you are familiar with Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegone, you'll know that it is town "where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, and all the children are above average."  And if you are at all familiar with statistics, you'll know that is impossible. It is impossible for all children to be above average - just as it is impossible for all children to be gifted . It's not even possible for half of the children to be above average, let alone gifted. If you understand that as I do, then you will be as puzzled as I was when I read this opening line of an article by Jessica Brown:How can more than half the students in one district be gifted? And it's not even the highest percentage in the state. In fairness to Ms. Brown, the article isn't about the high number of gifted kids; it's about the number of gifted children who receive services, and in this case, it's five percent. Considering that the gifted population is somewhere between three and five percent, five percent being served isn't so bad. Of course, the question is whether that five percent consists of the kids who are truly gifted. But that's my question, not Ms. Brown's. Ms. Brown rightly points out the problems encountered when getting gifted children the academic services they need, including problems with identification.  Her article, " Gifted kids may not be well-served ," is actually quite good, so I'm not complaining about it.  The first line just made me think. While some towns may have a greater percentage of gifted kids than other towns, none will have fifty percent of its children be gifted. What is important is that all children get the academic services they need. That is as true no matter how many gifted children there are in a community. Gifted kids may not be well-served
