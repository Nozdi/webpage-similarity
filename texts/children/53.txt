Is your child getting enough sleep at night? According to a new study by doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, chronic lack of sleep may be linked to obesity and accumulation of body fat (such as around the abdomen) that may lead to illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease.

If your child seems tired during the day, has trouble focusing or concentrating in school or is moody or irritable, she may need need more sleep. (Doctors recommend at least 10 to 11 hours of sleep daily for school-age kids, and even more for younger children.) Watch for signs that your child is sleep-deprived, and make sure you instill good bedtime routines and sleep habits to help your child get the rest she needs.
