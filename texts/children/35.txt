"... the truth is that you don't HAVE to learn the rules if you don't want to. It's really your choice. But ... as with any choice, there are consequences. If you want a career, a date, an invitation, a friend or even to get along with the NT's in your family ... you have to learn their language. "Social-ease." You may never be fluent, and you may always have an "Aspie accent," but at least you'll know what to (try) to say.Just imagine moving to some other country and being expected to speak their language, know the customs and follow every one of their super-complicated laws -- without anyone ever explaining them to you. And if you mess up, you could (and probably would) get fired, be laughed at, left out, bullied, or even arrested. Would that be fair? Of course not. But that's what it's like for us, trying to follow a set of hidden social rules without the rule book. To us, they're not rules, they're secrets. It's no wonder we feel left out so often. You won't just "know" things that are not part of the way you, as Asperkids, operate ... any more than I will suddenly know what it's like to wake up blonde....If, in the end, you can't remember any of the other rules that follow, please learn this one -- write it out on a piece of paper, tape it to your bathroom mirror, whatever you need to do -- just memorize it.
