A message from HandHold Adaptive about what makes this app special: "iPrompts is a software application for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, designed by the parents of a boy with autism in conjunction with speech pathologists and other professionals. iPrompts allows parents, therapists, and special educators to configure and present picture-based prompts to help language and behaviorally challenged individuals stay on task, transition between activities, and communicate their needs. The app features web-searching and photo management capabilities to augment the several hundred rich, bright and positive feeling illustrations and photos which come standard."
