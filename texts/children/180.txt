We can all sometimes feel helpless when we experience or even just hear about catastrophes and tragedies. Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, kidnappings, school shootings -- all these events can affect us profoundly. However, children can be even more profoundly affected because they look to adults to keep the world safe, and when things happen that even adults have no control over, they can lose their sense of security.Gifted children, especially those who are exceptionally sensitive can be even more profoundly affected by such events. These children may also feel that loss of security, but they can feel even more. Some of these children feel deep empathy for the victims of catastrophes and tragedies. The pain and suffering of the victims and their loved ones is felt deeply by emotionally sensitive children, so deeply at times, that it is almost as if they are personally involved.Some gifted children will also feel a sense of responsibility. That does not mean that they believe that they are in any way responsible for the catastrophe or tragedy happening. It means that they feel a responsibility to make things better, to help those involved recover. It's hard enough for children to cope with the feeling of insecurity such events can trigger, but when they feel as though it is their responsibility to make things better, they can feel overwhelmed and become depressed.
