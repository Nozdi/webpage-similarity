I asked Julia Roberts, co-founder and executive director of Support for Special Needs (and a finalist herself for Favorite Special-Needs Parenting Blog), to tell us why it's special: "We wanted to create a place where anyone parenting a child with special needs would feel welcomed. We deliberately built a community that would unite people because we know that we all tend to group via diagnosis and we felt like it was important to welcome the wisdom that every parent has. After all, a parent whose child has autism might have some great IEP insight that would benefit a parent whose child has mental illness. We also are about creating off-line connections so that our members have more than a virtual community to lean on. One way we did this was pitch a get together at BlogHer '11 and it became a well-received Mini-Con for special needs bloggers and we're already helping plan 2012. This year we've brought some great special needs bloggers into the fold by having weekly featured articles from author Robert Rummel-Hudson and weekly round-ups by JenLee Reeves [whose community, Born Just Right, is also a nominee in this category], among others."
