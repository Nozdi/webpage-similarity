Sometimes when we talk to our children's teacher or principal, we hear some pretty crazy comments. For example, when my son was in third grade, he was reading like a 7th grader (with 12th grade comprehension). I tried to get more appropriate reading instruction for him, but couldn't convince either his teacher or his principal of the need. Although the principal admitted that my son had clearly mastered third grade reading skills, he said still needed to do the third grade reading so he could practice third grade reading skills.Share your "crazy" comments.
