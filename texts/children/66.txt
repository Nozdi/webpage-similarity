Does your child's diet often include processed foods, soda, and other food and beverages containing high fructose corn syrup? If so, consider this reality check: A new study of 559 teens has found a link between diets that are high in fructose and increased risk for health problems such as diabetes, higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.

Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia at Georgia Health Sciences University examined the diets of 559 teens between the ages of 14 and 18 and found a link between high consumption of fructose and higher blood pressure, insulin resistance, and factors that contribute to heart and vascular disease. The researchers emphasize the importance of a healthy diet and exercise, and urge parents to keep an eye on the amount of high fructose corn syrup that is ingested by kids at home and at school.

So the next time your child reaches for a soda or junk food, remember to consider the effects of what he eats now on his body in his teen years and beyond.
