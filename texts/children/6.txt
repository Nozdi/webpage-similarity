I asked author Wendy Kupfer what makes her book special, and she wrote: "Inspired by my own daughter's profound hearing loss diagnosed at only 10 months of age, I wanted to write a story that would have helped her through the tougher of times. So was born Let's Hear it for Almigal, a feel-good, giggle-out-loud picture book that helps children accept and celebrate their differences -- showcasing a spunky little girl with a big personality named Almigal who wants to hear 'every single sound in the whole entire universe!'"

In a Reader Review offor this site, reader Needcoffeeplease wrote, "I lovedfor so many reasons. The book was not only about what hearing loss is (for example, Almigal couldn't hear her parents say 'we love you' after tucking her in at night, even with her aids) but it explains, in kid terminology, what hearing aids are and what cochlear implants are as well. It also tells how all of the kids in Almigal's class are different -- one speaks a foreign language, one wears glasses, and yet another wears hearing aids just like she does."
