It's not only the things he learned that will help with school success, it's his development of 1st grade skills in the social, physical and cognitive realm that's important, too.

In kindergarten, your child learned to socially interact with his peers and teachers. This year, he'll continue to develop and hone these skills and also begin to learn to see things from other people's points of view.  These social skills and a few others will him have well on his way to a successful first grade year.
