Surgery for Penis Enlargement

 Surgery offers the only permanent solution for enlargement of the penis. Through surgery, the penis can be visually enlarged, usually by just over an inch. The surgeon will cut the ligaments that hold the penis in its usual position, allowing the penis to descend. Weights, or stretching devices, are then used for a few months to affect a permanent increase in size. The procedure may result in scar tissue, the erection will point down, and the base of the penis will be hairy.

Another surgical technique is known as a dermal implant. Girth and length can be increased by transplanting fat cells from other parts of the body to the penis. As the size of head of the penis cannot be increased, the results can be visually rather odd.

Sometimes the distribution of the grafted cells results in clumping and a gives a far from smooth result. Many urologists will not perform this type of surgery unless there are good therapeutic reasons.

Cost of Surgical Enlargement of the Penis

 Costs for this type of surgery, be it penile lengthening, widening or enhancement, range from $4000 to $5000 dollars, and up to $17000.

Post Operative Complications and Penis Enlargement

 As with any form of surgery, there are a number of potential risks -- both psychological and physical.
