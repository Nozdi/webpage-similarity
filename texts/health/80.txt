PID is a serious disease that is most often sexually transmitted; however, pelvic inflammatory disease can result from any type of pelvic procedure. If PID is left untreated it can have devastating effects on the female reproductive system, and in some cases may result in death. If you have or suspect you may have pelvic inflammatory disease see your health care provider immediately for treatment.

Remember it is always your choice to seek a second opinion if you are uncomfortable or have any unanswered questions about the treatment recommended by your health care provider.
