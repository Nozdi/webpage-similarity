A local anesthetic is administered prior to the operation. The vas deferens are operated on one at a time. A very small incision is made and the tube is cut then sutured, cauterized, or clipped to closed them off. In a no-scalpel vasectomy a special forcep punctures (rather than cuts) the skin. In the one tiny puncture both tubes are tied off , cauterized or blocked. This procedure does not require any sutures.

Both types of vasectomy have the same result in as much as it makes the man sterile by keeping the sperm out of the seminal fluid. The sperm continue to be produced in the testes but are absorbed into the body with no ill effects. What this means is you will still ejaculate fluid as before, but without the sperm in it, there is no danger of an unwanted pregnancy.
