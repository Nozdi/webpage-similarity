Chlamydia is not treated with penicillin, as is the case for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Care must be taken to assure that all of the prescribed antibiotics are taken, regardless of whether symptoms are still present or not. Your health care provider may require you to return about one or two weeks after the medication is taken to be sure that the chlamydial infection is no longer present.

Remember it is always your choice to seek a second opinion if you are uncomfortable or have any unanswered questions about the treatment recommended by your health care provider.
