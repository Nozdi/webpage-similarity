The National Institute on Aging currently funds 29 Alzheimer's Disease Centers (ADC's) at major medical institutions across the nation. Researchers at these centers are working to translate research advances into improved care and diagnosis for Alzheimer's patients while, at the same time, focusing on the program's long-term goal--finding a way to cure and possibly prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Areas of investigation range from the basic mechanisms of AD to managing the symptoms and helping families cope with the effects of the disease. Center staff conduct basic, clinical, and behavioral research.

Each of the 29 centers has its own unique areas of emphasis. One of the program's major benefits is the opportunity for collaborative studies that draw upon the expertise of scientists from many different disciplines.

Centers also have significant responsibilities related to information transfer and the training of scientists and health care providers new to AD research. A common goal of the ADC's is to enhance research on AD by providing a network for sharing new ideas as well as research results.

Currently, 27 ADC-affiliated satellite facilities offer diagnostic and treatment services and collect research data in underserved, rural, and minority communities.

For patients and families affected by AD, many ADC's offer:
