Do you have trouble getting to sleep at night? If so, you've probably tried many things including prescription and non-prescription drugs to help you sleep, often without relief.

A few weeks ago, I received a sample product that claims to put you to sleep in less than 7 minutes without drugs. OK, that sounded good so I decided to try the device. Wow, was I surprised each time I used the product, I did fall asleep in less than 7 minutes and I slept better throughout the night.

So, what is this "magic" sleep product? It's called NightWave. It's a small box that flashes a blue light from bright to dim over and over again for 7 minutes. All you have to do it watch the light as it brightens and dims and soon the flow of your breathing follows the light. It's magnificent!
