The male orgasm is a complex experience. The major function of the male orgasm is the ejaculation of sperm, though not all men ejaculate with orgasm. The function of the female orgasm is less clear, although it may help to move the sperm toward the ovum (egg).

In the 1950s, Alfred Kinsey, the first scientist to study human sexuality in any detail, described the orgasm as "an explosive discharge of neuromuscular tension!" There is still a lot about the male orgasm that is not entirely understood.

Ejaculation and the Male Orgasm

 As noted above, it is possible to have a male orgasm without ejaculation.

Physical Experience of the Male orgasm

 The male orgasm seems to have psychological as well as physical effects. Some men describe a focal experience, feeling the orgasm exclusively in the scrotum and the genital area. Other men report their orgasm as a sensation that spreads to some parts of the body. Other men state that their orgasms are felt throughout their bodies. How much of the sensation of orgasm is physical and how much psychological is difficult to judge.

What Happens During the Male Orgasm?

 During intercourse, as a man nears orgasm, his pelvic thrusts become less voluntary and muscles of the penis begin to contract rhythmically in order to eject semen from the urethra. When an orgasm begins, heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increase.

 Although similar in some ways, there are differences between the male and female orgasm.
