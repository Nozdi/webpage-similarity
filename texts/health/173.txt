Most of us know we should have an annual checkup, but do we actually do it? If we have one every year, do we actually know if it is complete? And do we understand the tests and examinations we are having done? Most of us will answer "no" to at least one of those questions.

However, there is no excuse for not having a thorough yearly exam. Medicare is now covering many of the tests that should be done during your annual checkup.

You should review all medications with your doctor, even over-the-counter medications. You should also discuss having a flu shot. If the flu vaccine is not yet available during your exam, make a follow-up for that.

If you are a diabetic, your doctor should examine your feet and order additional tests for your blood sugar.

Your annual checkup is also the time to discuss any emotional problems you are having. If you feel sad or lack energy, tell your doctor. Your emotional health is just as important as your physical health.
