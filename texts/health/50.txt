You consider yourself a smart woman. You see your gynecologist every year, and perform your breast self-exam monthly. You try to watch what you eat and find time for exercise whenever possible. You almost always practice safe sex -- well there was that one time you forgot.

Are you taking time to do the things that can reduce your risk of cancer, heart disease, and other health conditions? If you are like most women, there are probably a few areas of your health habits that could use a little improvement.
