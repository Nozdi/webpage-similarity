Celebrated by the Autism Society since the 1970s to spread awareness about autism and now autism spectrum disorders (ASD), April is National Autism Awareness Month.

Have you wondered about what early warning signs for autism are? Researchers are finding that screenings can be done earlier than previously believed, and a simple questionnaire can help identify children at-risk for autism as early as at their first birthday. This article discusses 7 red flags of autism and provides information about this easy questionnaire as well.

The good news is that earlier screening leads to earlier intervention. Because children's brains are so malleable when they are young, the earlier that services are introduced in a child's life, the better. Early intervention services for children with ASD can be very helpful and can reduce the negative outcomes that ASD has on someone's life.
