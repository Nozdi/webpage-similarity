Truly being in touch with yourself and knowing what's important to you is crucial in order to live your best life. If that requires a little time out and putting your own needs before others, some may consider that to be selfish. If that's the case, I'm all for selfishness, and wrote a piece on the importance of selfishness. Once you're in touch with your needs and desires, you'll be better able to express them to others, and will enjoy more authentic and meaningful relationships as a result. Just don't be a jerk while taking time out for yourself, and then selfishness may not be such a dirty word.

Related to the importance of being selfish, I share a little bit about my experience as a couples therapist on three common mistakes that so many people in relationships make. While these mistakes may be innocent in nature, they can have devastating effects on your relationship and keep you stuck in common patterns of disconnect.

My advice of the day for a better life is therefore to get more selfish, express your truth to the important people around you, and stop making these 3 common mistakes in your relationship.

Let me know your thoughts and how being a little more selfish works for you!
