A study led by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has found that men who drink more than 35 alcoholic beverages per week are at much higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation, a dangerous heart rhythm disorder. Atrial fibrillation is one of the leading conditions that can lead to stroke. Among heavy drinkers the risk of developing atrial fibrillation is about 45% greater than for non-drinkers.

These findings may also help to explain a phenomenon known as "holiday heart syndrome" or heart rhythm disorders that develop around holidays or vacations when alcohol intake may be much higher. Intake of four or more drinks per day was seen as increasing the risk of developing atrial fibrillation significantly. Moderate alcohol intake (less than 2 drinks of wine, beer or other spirits) did not appear to increase risk at all.

Atrial fibrillation refers to a rapid, ineffective and irregular heartbeat that develops when muscles in the heart's upper chambers contract too quickly. the heart does not pump the blood effectively from the heart. This may cause blood to pool and clots may form. If these travel to the brain and lodge in an artery cutting off circulation to brain tissue a stroke may result.People who have atrial fibrillation have five times the risk of suffering a stroke as does the general population.

Strokes caused by blood clots can have effects from mild to debilitating depending upon the amount of brain tissue damaged. Stroke can lead to paralysis, aphasia, and death depending on severity with risk increasing as one ages.

Excess alcohol intake is a leading cause of liver disease, falls and automobile accidents among seniors and is now implicated in one of the most serious heath conditions that affect seniors.
