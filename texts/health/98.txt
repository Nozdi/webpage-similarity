"My mom never talked to me about menopause though. She says her mother never talked about it either."

"I'm not sad I'm past menopause. I'm just glad those monthly periods are over."

"Is it hot in here, or is it me?"

Menopause or the "change of life" affects each woman in a different way. Maybe hot flashes and sleep problems troubled your sister during menopause. You, however, might be feeling a new sense of freedom and energy. Your best friend may hardly be aware of a change at all.
