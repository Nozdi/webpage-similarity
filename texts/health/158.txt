It is unrealistic for you to feel that your partner should know what you want or need. It would be nice if they did, but expecting it is a romantic fantasy. Directly communicating your needs, wants, and feelings is necessary for your partner to learn better to provide you with what you need. Similarly, don't assume you know what your partner wants; ask your partner so you can more effectively meet your partner's needs.

It is important to learn to only make complaints that include specific statements about what you would like your partner to do instead of the problem behavior. For example, instead of just saying, "I wish you would stop hanging around with those guys," you could include, "It would be nice if you spent some time each night with the kids helping them with their homework and maybe on Friday nights we could go out to the movies." Your goal should be to give your partner something specific to try to do so your partner can demonstrate an effort to change.
