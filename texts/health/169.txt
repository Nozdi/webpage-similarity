There has been talk of taking these drugs off the market for years. Since 1978, the FDA has received two requests to remove propoxyphene from the market. But, until this point, the FDA had concluded that the benefits of propoxyphene for pain relief at recommended doses outweighed the risks. Why the change? A study has now shown that, even at recommended doses, propoxyphene can affect the electrical activity of the heart -- increasing the risk for serious abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to serious side effects, including death.
