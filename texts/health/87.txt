Definition: A usually sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhea. Can also be transmitted through infected bodily fluids in infants or by infants in homes with infected family members. Symptoms included severe pain and discharge in males, while women often experience no symptoms of gonorrhea. However, infected women who do not receive treatment may experience oophoritis, tubal and/or ovarian abcess, and peritonitis. Women diagnosed with gonorrhea often are also diagnosed with chlamydia. In both males and females, skin lesions, arthritis, and rarely meningitis or endocarditis can occur. Several pharmaceutical treatments are available.
