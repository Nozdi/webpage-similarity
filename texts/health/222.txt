The good news is that Americans are living longer than ever. The bad news is that the burden of eldercare is being placed on family unprepared emotionally, physically and financially to cope with the demands. Seniors with chronic mental and physical illness place an even larger demand on family caregivers that can be overwhelming. But, help has arrived in this book that offers help in an entertaining and compelling form.

The author Jacqueline Marcell was a successful executive in the television industry, but that experience did not prepare her for the care her elderly parents needed. While dealing with her mother's frail heart and her father's difficult behavior she gained valuable experience that she shares in this book. She writes her story with a great deal of compassion and reality, many of the situations she deals with in getting the proper care for her mother are those same situations many of us have or will encounter as our parents age. She is down to earth and honest but also is able to give much in the way of concrete help and advice for a variety of situations that can arise. Among the topics covered are ways to get a proper diagnosis and the proper medications for a loved one's condition. She also discusses behavior modification techniques for handling difficult elders.

As a bonus this book includes an addendum by Rodman Shankle, MS MD, former Medical Director, U.C. Irvine Alzheimer's Center. A Physician's Guide To Treating Dementia outlines the latest in medical treatment available for treating this devastating condition. It is all explained in terms that are easy for the lay-man to understand.

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who will be caring for elderly parents, either now or in the future.
