Did you know that 1 of 3 women die of heart disease? Sadly, only about one-third of women know that heart disease is the #1 killer of women in the United States; it's also the number one killer of men. Not only can heart disease lead to death, but it can also lead to disability and a greatly decreased quality of life.

Heart disease takes many years to develop, often starting during the teen years. It's never too early or too late to start taking these preventative measures against heart disease.
