Question: How Can I Prevent or Reduce the Symptoms of Perimenopause?

Preventing and reducing the symptoms of perimenopause is easier than you might think when you have a clear picture of your monthly cycle and symptoms. Buy a journal, or use a calendar to record your symptoms throughout the month. Write down any symptoms you experience such as hot flashes, night sweats, and changes in your mood. Be sure to note when your period, or any bleeding, occurs and whether your period is heavy, normal, or light.

How To Make Your Menstrual Cycle Calendar

Be aware of changes that occur immediately before you experience perimenopause symptoms. For example: What is the temperature of your environment? Have you eaten any hot or spicy foods? Being overheated often triggers hot flashes. Reduce the thermostat and avoid hot, spicy foods if they are hot flash triggers. Other things you can do to help prevent or reduce the symptoms of perimenopause include:

The most important thing you can do for yourself during perimenopause is to stay active, volunteer, take a class, or just spend time visiting with your friends.
