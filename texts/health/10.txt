Unlike ministrokes, which are also known as transient ischemic attacks (TIA), whose symptoms resolve on their own in less than 24 hours, strokes leave behind long-lasting neurological impairments. The severity of these impairments depends on how large the damage is to the brain, and on the part of the brain that is affected.  Ministroke/TIA Basics   This type of stroke is caused by the physical blockage of blood flow to an area of the brain. The most common forms of ischemic stroke are: 
1) Embolic StrokeThis type of stroke occurs when a blood clot or a cholesterol plaque wanders into the brain until it reaches a narrow point where it becomes trapped.  This causes a blockage of the artery and prevents blood from reaching a section of the brain.  There are other, less frequent causes of embolic strokes which include: High Cholesterol Basics High Blood Pressure Basics Depending on the location of bleeding, a hemorrhagic stroke is further subdivided into Hemorrhagic strokes are most often caused by a ruptured blood vessel such as an aneurysm or a leaky arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Blood inside the brain produces a very severe headache, which is typically described by people as the worst headache of their lives. As blood accumulates in the brain, the normal brain tissues are pushed against the walls of the skull.  This process increases the pressure inside the brain, to the point that blood flow to the areas of highest pressure is completely interrupted.  These areas cease to function, and cause symptoms which can range from dizziness, nausea and vomiting to a headache accompanied by typical stroke symptoms.  Hemorrhagic stroke symptoms should never be ignored as very often they can evolve rapidly and in the worse cases they can lead to sudden death. Learn about the conditions that lead to stroke Source:
