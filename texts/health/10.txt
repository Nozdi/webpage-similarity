Unlike men, women often do not experience classic chest pain symptoms during a heart attack. Instead, they may feel less obvious sensations, such as pain in the jaw, neck, shoulders or back; stomach discomfort; sudden trouble breathing; and even flu-like symptoms, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

What's more, women (and men) who are obese, have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease, should be particularly concerned if they experience these symptoms.

The lesson here, said researchers, is that women need to be more aggressive in seeking care if they experience a sudden onset of any symptom that affects their daily life. Women also need to be assertive with their doctors if they feel they are having a heart attack.

That's a great piece of advice for men, too.
