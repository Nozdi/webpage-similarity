As a psychologist trained in Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples, I happen to see couples all of the time who are struggling with one of the common problematic relationship patterns in which one partner tends to shut down and withdraw.

I also see a lot of women in my practice who complain that their partners are shut down, and they start the process of psychotherapy not knowing how to reach them.

I imagine there are many folks out there who are not in psychotherapy, but who also experience the frustration of having a partner who withdraws. For those people struggling in their relationships, I am happy to share a quick article with some tips on how to get your partner to open up.

Of course, no cookie cutter recipe will work for everyone, but I'm hopeful that this article may help those of you struggling with a shut down partner look at your relationship in a new way. I'd love to hear your feedback if you have any.
