An interview with Theresa V. Grant, President of INCIID

Estimates are that one in six couples are affected by some degree of infertility. However, that number may be very misleading. Many couples opt to lead child-free lives rather than seek treatment for their infertility, and we believe they are rarely included in infertility estimates. Others suffer recurrent pregnancy losses which are, in a way, a form of infertility---and are not technically considered "infertile" because they are able to conceive.

INCIID is in the process of creating a survey designed to provide new insights about who is infertile, what kinds of infertility they are experiencing, what kinds of treatments have been successful for specific diagnoses, and much more. This survey will be conducted online, and is expected to be a source of important clinical information for practitioners as well as consumers.

When a couple has failed to conceive after one year of well-timed intercourse, they should seek expert care. In cases where the woman is older than age 35, treatment should be sought after six months of well-timed intercourse. If a woman knows that she has endometriosis or polycystic ovarian disease, the couple should move immediately to expert care. If the husband has known male factor infertility (low or no sperm count, poor morphology or motility, etc.), the couple should move immediately to expert care. If a woman has had two consecutive pregnancy losses, the couple should move to expert care.Women who have extreme pain associated with ovulation or menstruation may be at risk for endometriosis and should seek expert care. Women who are annovulatory (don't ovulate) or who have very irregular cycles may be at risk for polycystic ovarian disease and should seek expert care. Unmanaged, these diseases can cause serious barriers to fertility. However, early treatment and expert management can preserve a woman's fertility.Some of the more common causes of infertility are diminished ovarian reserve (older women or women with premature ovarian failure), blocked fallopian tubes (sometimes because of endometriosis pelvic inflammatory disease , and STDs ), endometriosis and polycystic ovarian disease. Low sperm count, poor sperm morphology (the shape of the sperm) and poor motility (the ability of the sperm to swim in the right direction) are also major contributors to a couple's infertility. The estimates are that overall fertility problems are 50 percent female and 50 percent male.Although still considered "uncommon" by many practitioners, evidence is mounting that many cases of "unexplained" infertility are actually the result of an immune system malfunction. There are many variances of immune problems--- ranging from antisperm antibodies to an outright rejection of a developing fetus. The good news is that there is greatly improved testing now available to screen for these problems, and new treatment protocols are netting unprecedented success rates.
