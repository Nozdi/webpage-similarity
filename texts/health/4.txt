After 14 years as your About.com Women's Health Guide, the time has come for me to say "goodbye." It's time for me to explore the many other options that have been available to me for a long time. However, it is with great sadness that I leave all of you who I have come to know over the years. Thank you all for the wonderful friendships, and kind words you've written to me over the years.

The good news is my content will remain here for your use when you need it.

Please feel free to contact me, as I continue my writing career. I will still love talking with you about your health issues, and help you in any way I can. So, it's so long for now, until we meet again somewhere down the road.
