Cancer of the uterus is the most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has written this booklet to help women with cancer of the uterus and their families and friends better understand this disease. We hope others will read it as well to learn more about cancer of the uterus.

This booklet discusses symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. It also has information about resources and sources of support to help women cope with cancer of the uterus.

Our knowledge of cancer of the uterus keeps increasing. For up-to-date information or to order this publication, call the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service (CIS).
