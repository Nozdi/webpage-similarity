Rogaine (minoxidil) is one of the brand names for the drug minoxidil. It is in a class of drugs called antihypertensives. It relaxes the smooth muscles of the arteries, causing vasodilation and lowering of blood pressure on the walls of the blood vessel.

Most people are most familiar with its use directly on the skin to treat hair loss caused by male pattern baldness (for both men and women).

For use to help regrow hair, Rogaine is supplied as a topical 2% or 5% solution. It is applied directly to the areas of the head experiencing hair loss, usually twice daily.

Rogaine was originally developed to treat high blood pressure (oral) that was unresponsive to other therapy. It generally takes several months of use to see results in hair growth. If this medication is discontinued hair loss will begin again within a few months of stopping treatment. This medication is available without a prescription in the US, but does require a prescription in Canada.
