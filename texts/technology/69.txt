If you enjoy remote outdoor activities that take you beyond the cell phone network, and you occasionally go alone, satellite communication is your best bet for staying in touch and for rescue in case of an emergency. DeLorme recently introduced a new model to its InReach line, the Explorer ($379 plus satellite plan), which includes built-in GPS navigation. "In addition to the messaging, tracking and SOS capabilities, users of the inReach Explorer can view, create or navigate routes and waypoints," states DeLorme. "An easy-to-follow map view displays routes, waypoints, tracks and messages geo-located onscreen for backtracking or self-rescue. The built-in digital compass, barometric altimeter and accelerometer sensors ensure accuracy and provide heading and bearing information, accurate elevation readings, speed and other useful trip statistics."

DeLorme has tried to make subscription to the device's satellite communication plan as affordable and flexible as possible. No-contract plans start at $14.95 per month. The InReach Explorer is waterproof and ruggedized, and packs a number of additional backcountry features, including free topo map downloads, two-way satellite text messaging, global satellite SOS, and real-time tracking.
