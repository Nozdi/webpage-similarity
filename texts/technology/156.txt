Real Racing 2 features all of the qualities needed to be a great racing game.  It has fast cars, a realistic atmosphere and some of the best multiplayer available for the iPad.  But where Real Racing 2 really takes it to the next level is in its ability to bring the racing to your HDTV.   As one of the first games to support 1080p out through Apple's Digital AV Adapter, Real Racing 2 truly earns the suffix "HD".

You can also check out Real Racing 3.  It's a free-to-play title, so you can get a look at the game play for free, but for those that don't like microtransactions, Real Racing 2 might still be the best choice.
