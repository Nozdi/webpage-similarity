One of the reasons that computer sales have been lagging lately is that many people find that their old computers are good enough. This is also one of the primary reasons that many new computers are looking to use more energy efficient processors that provide enough performance but can help them reduce costs by using smaller batteries or extend their running time. But what if you want a low cost computer that also offers some good performance and doesn't skimp on features? Find out in my review of the Lenovo G410 might be the kind of laptop to fill that role.
