Let's face it, consumers just did not find Windows 8 that appealing. There are a large number of consumers out there that would rather have Windows 7 instead. HP decided to do something about this by offering a number of new desktop and laptop computers that would come with the old OS. This includes a low cost 15-inch laptop that doesn't go with the trend of touchscreen displays. But is this $500 laptop able to compete with features and performance or did HP just try to use Windows 7 to sell some PCs? Find out in my review of the HP 15-d090nr laptop.
