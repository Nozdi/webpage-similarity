This game is basically your everyday FPS (first person shooter) game. Like Quake and Unreal Tournament, it has intense fighting via different weapons. Like many other games, there are great strategies, such as having your team cover every entrance in a room, killing enemy after enemy at ease. The game is highly detailed, with good graphics, game play, and audio.

The gameplay is similar to many other FPS games. You walk around, fire some bullets, kill people, etc. The top strategies are using cover, following teammates around, and getting the good weapons. The weapons are all great, with everything you need to blast other players. Movement is as easy as ever, allowing you to quickly run away from enemies, and use hit-and-run tactics to kill your foes.

The graphics are great, with everything fully textured and 3D. Nothing feels out of place or blank. The audio has everything you need, from machine gun rattling to loud echoing sniper shots. No disappointment in the look and feel department.

The best part of many FPS games is the graphic quality. The detail of the units, weapons, bullets, and terrain in general is stunning. Of course, if you have an older computer, the graphics will have to go down in order to keep the game going at a decent pace. I warn people with very old computers not to try this game, because the game, first of all, is not 100 percent stable, and your computer, if old enough, can crash almost immediately upon opening the game.

If you like fast-paced shooters, this is for you! It is completely free in terms of price, and you will be impressed by this game's graphics, audio, and gameplay. Just remember that you should have a new computer in order to run this on high quality. There are only three goals you should be achieving while playing: Running, firing, and of course having fun!
