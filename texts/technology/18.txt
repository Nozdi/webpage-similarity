As you might expect from a phone aimed squarely at the more business end of the market, security options in the BlackBerry 10 operating system have not been ignored. There are in fact several different ways to protect your BB10 phone, ranging from the BlackBerry ID to the more standard screen lock, whether your phone is the Z10, Z30 or the Q10.

Your BlackBerry ID is the email address and password you use to gain access to BlackBerry websites, app store and other BlackBerry services. If you use the same BlackBerry ID on all of your devices, it can make transferring data from one device to another much easier. You can use your BlackBerry ID to log onto the BlackBerry website and keep track of app purchases and payments in BlackBerry World, start or stop the BlackBerry Protect service, which allows you to track a lost phone, and make the most of the backup and restore features offered. While it does nothing to actually lock the phone, setting up your BlackBerry ID features, especially BlackBerry Protect, is one of the first things you should do when you get a new BB10 phone.

BlackBerry Protect allows you to track the current location of a lost phone, assuming location services are on. You can make it ring, for when you have simply mislaid the phone at home or at work, and you can also display a custom message on the lock screen of the lost phone, giving instructions to anyone finding it on how to return it to you. If you suspect the phone has been stolen, BlackBerry Protect allows you to apply a lock remotely, change the password or delete all of the data contained on the device. If your device is provided by your employer, the administrator may have disabled or blocked some of these features.

Setting a password lock on your phone is another of the things you should do almost immediately, even if you don't think there is anything of value on there to a thief. While your device is locked you can still receive calls and notifications, you can even make emergency calls. You will be able to check battery status, set an alarm or take a picture with the phone locked.

To set up a device password, tap the settings button and look in the security and privacy section for the device password option. Enable this option and choose a password when prompted. For the sake of security, make sure to select the options for locking the device on screen lock or lock when holstered. You can also choose to set the phone to lock itself after a period of inactivity.

Make a note of your password and keep it somewhere safe (at home, rather than carried with you). If you forget the password, you cannot retrieve it using your BlackBerry ID. Enter the wrong password ten times and the phone will automatically delete all of the device data for security reasons. It is therefore also a good idea to back up your phone data regularly.

A picture password consists of a combination of a picture and number gesture, making it easier to unlock your device with one hand. The number of possible combinations is almost endless. To enable picture password on your BB10 device, you will first have to set a device password as shown above. This is needed as a backup, in case you forget your picture password.

Swipe down from the top of the home screen and tap the settings button. Head in to the security and privacy section and tap device password. Flip the Picture Password switch to On. Enter your device password, then choose your picture and number combination. Follow the instructions on screen to complete setup.

As a further security measure, you can apply a PIN code to the micro SIM card in your BB10 device. This helps to prevent your SIM card being removed from your phone and used in another device, as the SIM will not function without the PIN being entered correctly. You will need to turn on micro SIM card security in the BlackBerry settings, and contact your carrier to get the PIN code.
