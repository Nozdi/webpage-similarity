Zoombak was one of the pioneers in making GPS tracking consumer-friendly, and its diverse line reflects its experience in the field. Offerings include a car & family package, a "universal" locator, and a Zoombak just for pets. The car device may be installed on a vehicle and connected to the car power, or kept separate/portable and run on battery power. The car package includes an AC/wall charger, portable car charger, and a car installation kit that taps into the car's 12V power. Like most other devices in this review, the car unit can do continuous tracking via a website, or send you alerts when it enters or leave geofences you set up.

Zoombak's pet version, the SpotLight, may be ordered with a pet collar, or mounted on an existing collar.
