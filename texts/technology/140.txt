The latest rumor making the rounds is that split-screen multitasking will finally make its way onto the iPad with the iOS 8 release. Microsoft's Surface and Samsung's Galaxy Note already have this ability, but while the iPad has some multitasking features, we are still just limited to a single app on the display at once.

The ability to view two apps at once has a lot of huge benefits, including the easy of copying and pasting from one app to another. And with the iPad quickly closing in on the performance and speed of laptops, it would make sense to add more functionality to the operating system to cash in on the performance. This will be especially true if Apple releases a 12-inch iPad, as is rumored.

We'll have to wait a little longer to find out if the iPad will get split screen support. Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference starts in June, which is where the next version of iOS will be revealed to the world.
