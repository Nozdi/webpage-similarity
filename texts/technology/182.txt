Getting the most from the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped means keeping up with what's going on at your network library -- many of which maintain blogs.

I got an email from the New Hampshire Talking Book Library yesterday about their blog. I liked it. In addition to information on services and how to use technologies -- such as the new BARD Mobile app -- I found a great list of digital Talking Books on baseball.

I loved seeing those book lists back in the days of their print newsletter. I look forward to more appearing on their blog.

I realized how much NLS material I get online now. I download books and magazines from the BARD site, transfer them to a blank cartridge, and listen to them on a Digital Talking Book Player.

I'm glad the library is still working on ways to improve service as the technology evolves.
