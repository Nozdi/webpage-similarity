If you travel well beyond the communications grid, and need to stay connected for safety or professional reasons, consider the DeLorme PN-60 combined with the DeLorme InReach two-way satellite communicator. The InReach works with all of DeLorme's handheld GPS line, as well as with smartphones. InReach is capable using communication satellites to send and receive e-mails and text messages, as well as providing automated tracking reporting, or sending an SOS to emergency services. The Earthmate PN-60 GPS has a high-res color screen, and comes with a full set of North American topographic maps included. It's also easy to load mapsets from DeLorme's vas map library. A digital compass, tides chart, and more make the PN-60 a good wilderness tool.
