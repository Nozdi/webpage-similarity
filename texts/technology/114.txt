May 21 2014 - Budget laptops are a tough market for manufacturers. They have to produce quality systems for as little as possible and that often involves trade offs in hardware or software features. Of course, each person might have a different idea of what they need in a budget laptop. Maybe it is for performance, portability or price. Below are my selections for the best budget laptops priced under $500 currently available for a variety of different uses and prices.

Note that these are Windows based systems with a traditional laptop design. If you are not tied to the Microsoft operating system, there are Chromebooks using the Google mobile operating system that can be found for around $300.
