Just point the bottom of the pill bottle near the ScripTalk Station Reader and hear label details read aloud. ScripTalk retrieves information from a small, infrared label sticker the pharmacist creates and affixes to the bottle.

With wider availability, the ScripTalk Station Reader from Envision America will save lives by eliminating medication errors among seniors and persons with vision and mobility impairments. It alleviates fears of misreading or forgetting instructions. The free device also offers users a more private, independent means of managing their medications.

Misreading medication instructions can be a matter of life or death. Each year, prescription errors and adverse reactions cause nearly 2 million injuries.

Medication mistakes are a leading cause of death and injury among America's surging senior population - a demographic that often struggles to read or remember what's printed on each pill bottle.

En-Vision America's ScripTalk Station Reader makes managing medications safe, stress-free, and private. ScripTalk uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) and text-to-speech technology to read aloud label data stored on a small sticker affixed to the bottom of the bottle.

The pharmacy must be equipped with ScripTalk to transfer data onto the special infrared labels. To date, the Pharmacy Freedom program has approximately 100 affiliates throughout the United States, according to Anna McClure, En-Vision America's marketing and industry relations director.

ScripTalk Station is free for seniors and those with vision and print disabilities. En-Vision America encourages potential users to register on their website to access the nearest pharmacy offering the service. The company also seeks to raise awareness among big pharmaceutical chains of the growing need for this technology.

At present, ScripTalk is available mostly in private pharmacy businesses.
