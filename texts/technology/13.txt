 Southern California CityPass
Good deal. Pay $328 ($284 for kids) and receive passes to 4 theme parks: Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure (3-Day Park Hopper) and one day each at Universal Studios Hollywood and SeaWorld San Diego. Must be used within 14 days after first admission. Purchase online or at one of the parks. Disney even throws in admission to both of its parks on the same day and one early entry pass. First (I think) discount program to include Disneyland. Buy direct from Disneyland via Kijubi. 2014 SeaWorld San Diego Fun Card
Unlimited admission to SeaWorld San Diego for all of 2014. (There are some blackout dates.) Cost is the same as a one-day ticket at the gate. Go San Diego Card
