There are some good iPhone apps available for GPS turn-by-turn driving directions, but they all have one thing in common: They work way better when the iPhone is placed in a specialized car mount. A mount holds the iPhone where you can see it, in vertical or landscape screen mode; charges the iPhone (a must for these battery-hog apps), and provides supplemental GPS power and a speaker and a mic. The new Magellan Premium Car Kit ($130) does all of this and more. I've been test driving the Magellan with an iPhone 3GS and Magellan's Roadmate 2010 North America app ($59) and found it to be a competent navigation package. Its speaker provides a nice sound boost to the app's text-to-speech directions. The Car Kit mount is also roomy enough to accommodate some thinner iPhone covers. One more plus, since the Magellan Car Kit has its own built-in GPS chip, it works (that's an official feature) with the Apple iPod Touch 2G, also. Image (c) Magellan
