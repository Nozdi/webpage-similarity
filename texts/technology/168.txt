The Jitterbug brings old comfort to new technology and makes it easy for users to stay connected. A large keypad, bright screen, powerful, Bluetooth-enabled speaker, and simple interface make calling refreshingly easy as smart phones continue to shrink in size and grow in complexity. Jitterbug users will never miss or want features and functions, such as a built-in camera, that are not there.

The Jitterbug is a cell phone built by Samsung for GreatCall Wireless, a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) based in Del Mar, California.

The phone's distinguishing feature is a simple interface featuring larger numbers and a brighter screen. The Jitterbug is designed for ease of use and is extremely popular among baby boomers and seniors.

GreatCall operates on the Verizon Network and offers prepaid and month-to-month service plans.

There are two Jitterbug phone models: the Jitterbug J ($99) a clamshell model, and the pared-down R100 ($39), which provides the same service with fewer features.

The Jitterbug J cell phone comes with a rechargeable battery, charger, and how-to and quick-start guides.

Among its many awards, the New York Times named the Jitterbug a "Top 10 Brilliant Idea" in 2006. GreatCall is also the sole mobile phone provider for the American Automobile Association, giving AAA members a $20 discount on handset purchases.

Martin Cooper, considered the father of the mobile phone, launched Great Call with Arlene Harris in 2006.
