: Diffutils includes four utilities: diff, cmp, diff3 and sdiff. * Diff compares two files and shows the differences, line by line. * The cmp command shows the offset and line numbers where two files differ, or cmp can show the characters that differ between the two files. * The diff3 command shows the differences between three files. Diff3 can be used when two people have made independent changes to a common original; diff3 can produce a merged file that contains both persons' changes and warnings about conflicts. * The sdiff command can be used to merge two files interactively. Install diffutils if you need to compare text files.
