Ascension is a rather interesting twist on the deck-building aspects of collectible card games. Rather than earn new cards between games, you purchase cards within the game. This is done by playing cards that give you runes, which you can then use to purchase new cards. But victory is determined by the player with the most honor, and honor is acquired through killing monsters. So you'll have to balance your desire to buy new cards by playing cards that give you power, which you can then use to kill monsters and gain that precious honor. It's a fun mix that plays out in part like a board game and in part like a card game. If you love the card-playing aspects of Hearthstone but want something a bit different, Ascension is a great choice.
