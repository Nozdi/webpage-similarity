The game developer Epic Games is launching a re-birth of the classic FPS (first person shooter) Unreal Tournament. The plan is to develop the game as open source, encouraging everybody to participate.



 The final product will be free for everyone. Once the the project is mature, Epic plans to set up a marketplace for third party mods that will bring revenues for both the mod developers and Epic. A first alpha release is expected in a few months.
