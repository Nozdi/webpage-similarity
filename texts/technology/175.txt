Smartphones and apps do amazing things, but many of us -- including seniors and persons who are visually impaired -- just want an inexpensive phone to make calls on and stay connected.

The ODIN VI Talking Mobile Phone is designed to be fully accessible to persons who are blind. It accomplishes this with a tactile number keypad, simple navigation, and text-to-speech that speaks aloud what's onscreen, the keys as you press them, and verbal prompts to aid orientation.

There's no web access or third-party apps, but you can make calls, add contacts, and manage a call log -- all from a touch-tone-phone-style keypad.

You can also send, receive, and listen to text messages, set alarms, and program up to 3 emergency numbers activated by simply pressing and holding any key for a few seconds.

Like the Jitterbug J, the ODIN VI strikes that elusive balance between convenience and comfort.
