With a price of around $1300, this Dell 24-inch display is extremely expensive but pretty much the only option for those that want the ultra high 4K or 3840x2160 resolution in a compact display. It uses the new IGZO display panel from Sharp that offers it exceptional color support with 99% of the AdobeRGB and 100% of the sRGB color gamuts. Brightness is also quite high at 350cd/m^2. This makes it an excellent option for those looking to do professional graphics work. Now it should be noted that to run the display at the 60Hz at the full resolution, you need to use a DisplayPort 1.2 compatible graphics card. There is an HDMI connector as well but it will only run at 30Hz as it is not HDMI 2.0. Other connectors include a second mini-DisplayPort, four USB 3.0 port hub and a media card reader. The display stand offers a full range of tilt, swivel and pivot.
