Many people who use graphics tend to design around the AdobeRGB color gamut. For this reason, it is important to get a screen that is very similar to displaying this color range. The NEC MultiSync LCD2690WUXi2-BK provides a 97.8% AdobeRGB color gamut that makes this excellent for graphics work. the screen also features a 1920x1200 resolution and a relatively quick 8ms response time. This isn't quite as fast for video and gaming but that isn't the point of the display. Connectors include a DVI-D and VGA. The stand allows for a full range of height, tilt, swivel and pivot adjustments and can be used with 100mm VESA wall mounts. Prices are around $1050.
