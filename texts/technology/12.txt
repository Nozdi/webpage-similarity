According to the asia today website, it looks as if the rumoured premium version of the Galaxy S5 could be hitting the stores as soon as June this year. The Prime, as this new model seems to be called, could feature a QHD display (meaning a resolution of 2560x1440), a more powerful octa-core Exynos 5430 processor with a built-in LTE modem, and an upgraded Mali T6XXX GPU rated at 600MHz. It could also have the metal unibody that the original S5 was rumoured to feature.
