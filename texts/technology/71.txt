Google and GPS maker TomTom have partnered to make it easier to upload destination information into your in-car GPS. By following the instructions in this how-to, you can simply click on "send" in Google Maps to upload destination addresses and locations into your TomTom in-car GPS. This feature is very useful for quickly uploading a cluster of destinations you'll need as part of a vacation or business trip. With all of your destinations pre-loaded as favorites, you can focus on the purpose of your trip, rather than how to get to your next destination. Here's how to make use of this feature.

Time Required: 20 minutes for initial setup. Just a few seconds to send an address.
