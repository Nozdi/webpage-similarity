Checking the connection speed of your home Wi-Fi is extremely easy if you have a computer, with several reliable websites offering speed tests at the touch of a button. But what if the only way you ever go online is on your phone, and there is no PC in the house? Luckily, there are several apps available for Android, Windows Phone 8 and Blackberry phones which let you run a speed test not only on your Wi-Fi connection, but also to see what sort of 3G and 4G speeds you are getting. One of the best available is from respected speed testing website speedtest.net.

Search for "speedtest" on the Google Play Store and look for the app from speedtest.net. There are several different options available for checking the speed of your Wi-Fi connection, but this one seems to be just about the most reliable and accurate. Speedtest.net Mobile uses Location Services to detect the test server closest to you, so if you have turned that feature off, or if have denied Speedtest.net access to that service, then the application will try to use GeoIP, which is less accurate.

If you selected no when asked to allow location services, or have otherwise turned off that service globally, you can adjust things in your Settings. On Android phones, go to Settings > Location & Security and turn on Use wireless networks and Use GPS Satellites. You now need to decide which connection to test. Speedtest.net can check both your Wi-Fi and your mobile data connection speeds, but one will override the other if you have them both turned on. Switch on the connection you want to test now.

You can now, finally, tap the "Begin Test" button on the main screen of the app. The speed dial will appear on screen, showing the speed attained in each of the ping, download and upload tests. Below the dial you can see the name of the server used. When the test has finished, the results are shown at the top of the screen, with a button to restart the test below the dial. To see more detailed information on the test, tap the Results tab at the bottom. This shows a list of all the test you have run, for comparison.

To test your other connection (mobile data connection for example) simply turn off Wi-Fi, turn on the data connection and run the speed test again. A symbol beside the test in the results tab shows if the test was Wi-Fi or mobile data. If you think the test server is wrong, you can select it manually in the setting tab. Try tapping Auto-select first to see if the app can try using your location again. If not, tap Change Server. Select the server you want to use from the list.

When performing a speed test on your 4G or Wi-Fi connection on your mobile, it is important to understand what the results actually mean.
