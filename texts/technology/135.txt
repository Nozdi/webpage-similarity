When the iPad was released in 2010, it didn't have any built-in print functionality. But it didn't take long for Apple to add this functionality to the operating system. AirPrint allows the iPad to see and communicate with AirPrint-enabled printers, making it easy to print documents from your iPad. You can print from Photos, Notes, Mail, the Safari browser and many apps downloaded from the App Store like Microsoft Office.

AirPrint-enabled printers are the easiest solution, and you can pick one up for as cheap as $70-$90. Any printer marked as AirPrint enabled or compatible with the iPhone/iPad will work. However, if you already own a printer and have no desire to upgrade, you can go the app-based route. View a list of AirPrint-enabled printers
