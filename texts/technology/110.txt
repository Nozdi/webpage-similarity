An easy way for a company to produce a new low cost laptop is to essentially take an existing design and tweak it. This is exactly what Toshiba elected to do by taking the previous Satellite C55 chassis and putting the new AMD low power platform inside of it. One would expect that because it has low costs to adapt an existing design they might be able to improve some of the internal components. But was the choice to use an older and larger chassis a good one for a chip designed for smaller and power limited situations? Find out in my review of the Toshiba Satellite C55Dt-A5148 laptop.
