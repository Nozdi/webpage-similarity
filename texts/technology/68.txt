Garmin's running and fitness GPS watch line continues to grow with the introduction of the new Forerunner 15 ($169). The Forerunner 15 is Garmin's lowest-priced watch that works with a wireless heart rate monitor strap, and a foot pod, which is useful for measuring indoor treadmill or indoor track workouts. This new watch may also be used to monitor your all-day activity and for counting your steps and calorie burn. All of its data may be uploaded, stored, analyzed, and shared on Garmin's free Connect service. The watch is available in multiple colors, including teal (shown here), violet, black, and red.
