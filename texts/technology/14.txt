October 21, 2013 Apple’s iOS was so far never taken too seriously by the enterprise sector. But now, with the entry of iOS 7, small and mid-sized establishments are eyeing the upgrade and are actually considering moving to it. The new-and-improved OS upgrade brings with it several features including easy mobile device management, central control and additional security, which are very suitable to the present BYOD environment in the enterprise sector. While Apple’s main rival, Android, is already capitalizing on its easy-to-manage, open interface, the main issue with this OS is the security concerns that it raises. With its stylish new look and impressive functionality, the iOS 7 is now gaining much praise from the business sector. Here are the major reasons why this upgraded OS version could be beneficial for enterprise: The major issue with employees using personal mobile devices in the workplace is the level of security that the devices can offer. Many of these employees may store sensitive office data in their devices, without taking adequate measure to protect these gadgets against loss or theft. Leakage of classified information via hacking lost or stolen devices can put the establishment at grave risk. The Activation Lock feature offered by iOS 7 makes it difficult for thieves to crack the phones to retrieve information. The fingerprint scanner, which works along with the passcode, offers additional security. Of course, these safeguards may not be able to offer complete security at all times – there are reports, already, of fingerprint and passcode hacking. However, Apple has taken steps in the right direction, to ensure that the latest OS offers far more security than any of its previous versions. iOS 7 offers more options not only for general security, but also for security of apps in particular. This latest upgrade includes several features that aid IT departments manage employees’ usage of corporate apps and data. IT managers can now use the OS’ features to keep a tab on employees’ activity, also ensuring that they separate their professional life from their personal life. The new VPN or Virtual Private Network enables the IT department to automatically configure apps distributed by the company to connect to its own private network, while denying that access to the users’ personal apps. The upgrade also offers features that can restrict third-party apps unless a passcode has been entered. This helps companies deny app access to employees who have been pulled out of service. A new Enterprise Single Sign-in functionality enables users to access the company’s entire suite of apps, by entering the passcode just once. The AirDrop functionality included in iOS 7 enables iPhone users to share files easily and wirelessly. This feature, which is currently used mostly for social sharing, would eventually speed up information-sharing among colleagues and during meetings. Apple’s iWork suite of apps is available free of cost for new iPhones running iOS 7. This software, which has been expressly created in order to offer competition to Microsoft’s free Office suite, clearly exhibits the giant’s intension to capture the enterprise sector, by offering far more value to its customers, than any of the other vendors are at present. Apple aims to offer users only the very best with its latest iOS upgrade. While it is a fact that no mobile device or OS can ever guarantee complete security, one has to acknowledge that the company has put in tremendous efforts to try and solve some of the major issues faced today, by the IT sector in every enterprise. Given its several advantages, it is expected that the enterprise sector would soon warm up to the iOS 7 and absorb it into their daily functioning.
