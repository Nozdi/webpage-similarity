I've been playing around with and writing a lot lately about the ODIN VI Talking Mobile Phone.

It's a throwback. You can text, but finding letters on number buttons brings back memories.

I love the device's orientation that speaks everything aloud, making the phone fully accessible to seniors and persons with visual impairments.

Making calls, managing contacts, and changing the settings are all easy tasks. The slider phone is also sleek and simple to use.
