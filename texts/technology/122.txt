While the price tag ranging from $900 to $1100 may scare off many, the Dell UltraSharp U2711 is a spectacular display that manages to outperform many 30-inch screens. The 27-inch display uses IPS technology for some impressive color and a very high 2560x1440 resolution. Response times are slower at 6ms but it is still fast enough for dealing with video or even gaming. Those wanting to use it for graphics work will be happy with the wide color gamuts and color calibration for sRGB and AdobeRGB from the factory. Connectors are plentiful with DisplayPort, HDMI, Two DVI, VGA, composite and component. It also features a four port USB 2.0 hub and 7-in-1 card reader. The stand fully supports height, tilt and swivel adjustments.
