Last week, Meb Keflezighi became the first American to win the Boston Marathon in 31 years, and he did so while wearing a Garmin Forerunner 620 GPS watch. Keflezighi was sighted late last week at Garmin's headquarters in Olathe, Kansas to help kick off the Land of Oz marathon. Keflezighi met with Garmin's fitness and engineering team, and Garmin promises to reveal more stats and details about how he uses his GPS watch to race and train. Garmin hasn't published Keflezighi's marathon stats and track (yet), but I'll share the link if it becomes available. Image (c) Garmin
