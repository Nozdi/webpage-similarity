Now that Apple has introduced the iPad Mini, picking out the right model has become that much more difficult. Much like the full-sized iPad, the iPad Mini comes in two distinct flavors (4G and Wi-Fi only) with three storage options (16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB) and two different colors (black and white). This means choosing an iPad comes down to choosing between twelve different models, not including the color choice. And that also excludes the iPad 2, which will remain in production.

So which should you choose? The newest 9.7-inch iPad or the newly introduced 7.9-inch iPad Mini?

The Best Uses for the iPad

How Much Memory Do You Need on an iPad?

There is no clear perfect choice when picking out the right iPad. For many people, the iPad Mini will do everything they need an iPad to do and they will barely even notice the difference between the two tablets. For others, the bigger screen, sharper graphics and faster processor will make all the difference in the world.

The iPad Mini will be great for those who want an iPad they can take with them everywhere they go, who prefer casual games to hardcore games, who want to browse the web and do some work but will find most of their time spent watching movies, reading books and listening to music. And, of course, it is perfect for those who want to make the leap to the iPad but don't want to pay $499 for the cheapest iPad 4 model.

The iPad 4 is great for those who want to replace most of what they do on their laptop with their iPad. While it is the perfect home device, it is still quite mobile, and it has the power to satisfy both the user who wants to get a lot of work done and the owner who is into some of the more hardcore gaming offered on the iPad. And with the high-resolution Retina Display, the iPad 4 is much better for those who may have more difficult reading the smaller text on an iPad Mini.
