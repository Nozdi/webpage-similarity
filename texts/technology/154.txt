Plants vs Zombies was a refreshing take on the tower defense strategy game, and the sequel stays true to those roots.   This game is perfect for those who want the addiction of a strategy game without the need to spend hours on a single game session.  The levels get more intense as you go along, and you'll be able to play through different themes such as the Wild West and Ancient Egypt.

This is one of those rare entries when if you've never played the original Plants vs Zombies, the sequel is the best place to start. The free-to-play model used in the game isn't as aggressive or as annoying as some other apps that feature in-app purchases, so you can check it out without paying a dime.  And the original is so fully-featured and entertaining, you'll still have a ton of fun with it even if you play through the entire sequel first.
