Try all the mouse buttons in different regions (terminal, background, task bar).

Use the mouse buttons to copy and paste text from one terminal to another.

Find out how to configure your window manager; try different workspaces (virtual screens).

Add an applet, such as a load monitor, to the task bar.

Enable the so-called sloppy focus - this is when a window is activated by just moving the mouse over it, so that you do not need to click the window in order to be able to use it.

Log out and select a different session type, like KDE if you were using Gnome before. Repeat the previous steps.
