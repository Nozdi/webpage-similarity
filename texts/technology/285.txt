Assume you use a direct line to connect your system vstout to tiny . Much like in the modem case, you have to write a system entry in the sys file. The port command identifies the serial port tiny is hooked up to:

In the port file, you have to describe the serial port for the direct connection. A dialer entry is not needed because there's no need for dialing:

If you're just going to try out UUCP, get the number of an archive site near you. Write down the login and password--they're public to make anonymous downloads possible. In most cases, they're something like uucp/uucp or nuucp/uucp .

The only limitation is that it shouldn't be longer than seven characters, so as to not confuse UUCP implementations that run on an operating system that imposes a narrow limit on filenames. Names that are longer than seven characters are often truncated by UUCP. Some versions even limit the name to six characters.

The UUCP Mapping Project registers all UUCP hostnames worldwide and makes sure they are unique.

Older Version 2 UUCPs don't broadcast their name when being called; however, newer implementations often do, and so does Taylor UUCP.

For instance, most companies' private installations require you to dial a 0 or 9 to get a line to the outside.

The bit rate of the tty must be at least as high as the maximum transfer speed.

If the remote system runs Taylor UUCP, it will obey.

Some modems don't seem to like this and occasionally hang.
