AFB Press, a division of the American Foundation for the Blind, will soon release Basic Spanish for Orientation and Mobility: a Phrase Book and Dictionary, edited by Brenda J. Naimy and Matthew W. Hogel.

The manual arranges step-by-step lessons side-by-side in English and Spanish to help orientation and mobility professionals -- whose clients often vary in age, ethnicity, and cultural background -- teach blind and visually impaired persons who speak Spanish as their primary language.

Early purchasers can save $5 on the print and e-book editions through April 28th by ordering from the AFB Bookstore. The book is also available via subscription or as an ASCII file from AFB as well as Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com, and iTunes.
