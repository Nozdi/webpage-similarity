shell command: What are they? They are part of a shell. In other words, each shell (e.g., C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell) has a set of commands built into its program. Are the shell commands always the same on every computer? Though shell commands may vary from one shell to another, the commands within each shell stay the same across Linux / Unix distributions and variants. Where do I enter shell commands? The user types shell commands at the shell prompt, the default of which is % for the C Shell, and $ for the Bourne Shell and the Korn Shell.
