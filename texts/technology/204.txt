Central Access Reader (CAR) is a free text-to-speech program designed for students with print disabilities (e.g. dyslexia and visual impairment) that deciphers mathematical notations, equations, and symbols that most screen readers do not support.

The app recognize symbols from geometry and trigonometry, linear algebra, calculus, math, logic, or statistics and has attracted the attention of schools across the country, including MIT and Harvard.

CAR runs on both Mac machines and PCs. Download a free copy on the CAR project website.
