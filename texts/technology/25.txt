4G wireless has gotten plenty of hype recently, thanks to the launch of 4G networks from AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon Wireless, as well as the launch of the 4G-capable smartphones, like the HTC EVO 4G and the Samsung Epic 4G.

Despite all of the hype, 4G is a technology that's still in its infancy and is not yet widely available or well-understood. Here's a complete guide to 4G technology to help you learn everything you need to know about this high-speed wireless service.

4G is the term used to describe the fourth-generation of wireless service. 3G, or third-generation, networks, currently offer the most widely available high-speed wireless service. But more 4G services are becoming available, promising faster speeds.

4G wireless is supposed to deliver service that is anywhere from four to ten times faster than 3G networks. But not all 4G service is the same, and speeds can vary -- especially when you're using 4G service in the real world.

As of this writing (April 2011), all of the four nationwide cellular carriers offer some form of 4G wireless service. Find out who is offering it, and where you can access 4G wireless.

Just because your carrier is offering 4G service, that doesn't mean your existing phone will run on the network. Chances are, you'll need a new phone to take advantage of 4G speeds, as only a few handsets currently support 4G service.
