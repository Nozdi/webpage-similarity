Dell's Ultrasharp 1708FP is one of the few monitors in the model lineup that doesn't use a wide screen panel. The 1280x1024 resolution is typical for the screen size and it is bright like the Samsung but with a little less color clarity. It makes up for this by providing an excellent adjustable stand and a built-in four port USB 2.0 hub. There is also a version for the OptiPlex systems that has a different stand that should be avoided as it doesn't work as well with the standard design. Both VGA and DVI-D with HDCP connectors are supported.
