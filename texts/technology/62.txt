There are many golf GPS apps for the iPhone, so we cut the field down to the top five worthy of your consideration. iPhone apps involve some compromises compared to dedicated hand-held golf gps units, but deliver plenty of functionality. Keep in mind:

-These apps consume a lot of power. Start with a full charge, and use power-save modes when available.

 -iPhones are not water-resistant. Use a protective case or plastic bag in case of rain.

 -Don't bother with apps that make you "mark your own" course. Check course database links.

 -No free apps made the cut. You get what you pay for in this category.
