The iOS 6.0 update adds Facebook integration to the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. Not only does this integration make it easier to share photos and videos with your friends, it also allows you to 'like' apps you have discovered on the app store. This can be a great way to let your friends know what games you are playing or point them towards a really cool app you found.

Now that you have 'liked' a favorite app, where does it go? Facebook displays Likes on the new Timeline. The most recent likes will show up on the top right of the Timeline, while other likes will show further down the Timeline.
